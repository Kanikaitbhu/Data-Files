"I had gone there to spend a cosy close knit New Year’s Eve with family. We were looked after like we were their own. There were a few misunderstandings with our rooms booked online, but Mr Krishnan (GM) himself got involved and assured a very comfortable stay. Special thanks to Mr Rishi (Front Desk), Mr Rahul (Duty Manager) and Mr Amit (In Room Dining) who made us feel at home like family. Thank you all for the Tajness experience :)",5.0
"I have stayed in multiple Taj properties, obviously the best one was in Aguada. While checking in on  28th, I was constantly asked for deposit. I was told the mini bar will be removed, if deposit is not made. However, I told ,  I prefer to settle it while checking out , as I have done in my previous Taj stays. Once I checked into the room, I received a call from reception, that I have to give my card details, for keeping a reference in file. Now, once the in-room dining delivered the food in the room, the person who delivered insisted, that the bill has to be settled immediately. It seems Taj doesn't trust their customer at all, even three star hotels settle in room dining during check out. @Taj this is cheap, and being a TIC member, I will this is damn unprofessional. I did",2.0
"We checked in at Taj Palace, Delhi on 12-12-20 for one night with friends. We took 2 rooms with breakfast and the booking was done via Taj mobile software.  When we checked in the hotel, I was informed that our reservation is without breakfast. So I again logged in to the taj website and showed the hotel staff that the offer is still on the taj website. But to my surprise they told me that it's without breakfast and I will be required to pay for breakfast. Then they offered that they will allow 2 people Buffett breakfast but other 2 need to pay.  So basically, if Taj software/backend screws up, the Delhi Taj is so arrogent that they will not co-operate and you will bear the burden. I have stayed in many taj hotels in Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaipur and their staff is so so",2.0
"This iconic building located in the heart of Delhi, a stone away to the power centres at Lutyens Delhi, is close quarters with the seat of the government, city’s diplomatic corps, cultural centres and commercial hubs. Taj Mahal Hotel is an architectural marvel and an epitome of hospitality. The Hotel has 292 luxury rooms and suites which offers incomparable and spectacular views of the capital city. Consumer - God concept, a legacy of the Taj dominates the day-to-day affairs at the Taj Mahal hotel in New Delhi  At the outset, multi-layer safety protocols have been put in place, necessitated by the Covid crisis.

"We stayed at Taj Mahal for 1 night, to celebrate my husbands birthday. They made the occasion special with a yummy chocolate cake.  The grandeur of the hotel is amazing and because it was COVID times, the pool was closed.  The club room gave access to the lounge offered great variety of teas and snacks. The room size was average and we had a view of the Rashtrapati Bhavan from our room.   Karan from the front desk was very helpful during check in and upgrades. Rishi, one of their team members also ensured that we get an extended check out at 7pm(as we had to a hospital admission that evening and there were delays)  Machan is a restaurant that one shouldn’t miss.

"I spent a couple of nights in the Delhi branch of my favourite hotel chain, TAJ. As usual, the welcome is astonishing, and everything ay the Taj is delivered to the highest standard. As with my previous visit to India, I used this as respite after a week's study trip, and made use of all the facilities - like the laundry, pool and room service. I thought the breakfast was especially good here. As usual theta was faultless, and also really well located - there many auto rickshaws, Uber and a nearby tube station to explore Delhi, and so I was able to pack a huge amount into my three days, including a trip out to the actual Taj Mahal in Agra!.] My favouite staff member was Deepak who made me a delicious packed breakfast to take on my early departing flight.",5.0
"The staff is really lovely. The restaurant was also nice. We tried the Chinese restaurant the first night and as we were a big group the Manager helped us make sure there was not too much or too little food. It was perfect amount. The concierge at first seemed a bit lazy to help out with reservations for outside restaurants but than after me insisting on other options they came trough. The breakfast was also ok, basic options for foreigners that are scared of Delhi belly but the eggs were great and had fruits and bread options.  Nevertheless, the rooms.. oh boy the rooms.. pleaseee, do something about it. I felt like I was at an Agatha Christie room scenary. The bathrooms also,could really use a revamp.

"Spent time at this hotel on both the front and back end of a trip to India in February (remember those days, when we could travel the world???). The service was quite good...from the front desk agents, to all the support staff throughout the hotel. They have a great breakfast buffet, with both Western and Eastern food selections (take the opportunity to try new things!). Besides the restaurant where breakfast is served, there are a LOT of food options on-site, and a nice bar. As for the rooms...absolutely amazing pillows....I got such good sleep every night! They also have a nice shower with excellent water pressure. (When I travel, nothing wakes me up like a good strong shower!) The rooms also had plenty of bottled water, and a nice tea set-up. The biggest complaint was",4.0
"Everything exceeded expectations. We knew from long past visits that the Taj was an excellent hotel but even then we were overwhelmed by the friendliness, courtesy, warmth and efficiency (including the recovery of my iPad left behind in the plane seat pocket) of all the staff in these stressing Corona virus times. We were treated as royalty for all our 4 days from arrival to departure. The facilities despite ongoing refurbishment works were top notch. The location of the and the cuisine at the restaurants were superb. The attention to detail was amazing - restaurant and bar managers addressing you by name on second visits and asking if you wanted the same cocktail as on the previous night.  While there was nothing we did not like, the only improvement we would like at the Taj is",5.0

"I would like to let you know how much I enjoyed my stays at Taj Hotels.  I stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Dehli from 2 to 5 Feb 2020 and at the Taj Green Cove from 12 Feb to 19 Feb2020 at the Taj Green Cove Hotel Kovalam.  In both hotels, I experienced excellent service from the staff at the reception desk, who helped organise outings and were absolutely professional and charming. The staff in the restaurants were exceptional and could not have been more helpful and attentive.   The general managers and their at the Taj Green Cove were exceptional and made sure that every part of a guests stay was an exemplar in customer service.   I would like you to thank the staff at both hotels on my behalf and I assure you that following the excellent experiences at the Taj that I will",5.0
"We were celebrating the 45th anniversary of our parents with a family stay here. The pickup form the airport was efficient, the checkin was quick. Our parent’s suite was spacious and well appointed, our rooms were good with views of Presidents palace and India Gate. It is amazing to see that Delhi is still so green in these parts…  The property, though extremely well kept, is showing age in corridor carpets and much more in the bathrooms  - these are small and cramped with dark tiles, even in the suite. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment, which is great, but the constant drilling until 6pm can be annoying if you want to relaxed stay.   Breakfast in Varq was a small space with long queues, House of Ming was a much nicer experience.  The famous Machan was closed for renovation.",4.0
"Stayed here with colleagues for a series of meetings with representatives of the government - the hotel is very well located for that sort of engagement and the taxi service from the hotel very reliable.  The hotel is about 45 mins from the airport in normal traffic, but I’d allow a full hour if going back to the airport just to be safe.  The hotel is spotless, luxuriously presented and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. It contains a popular bar and restaurants, and club members have their own private restaurant and bar.  Rooms were great - good size, clean, comfortable bed, good shower, good work area and sufficient free internet (you can upgrade for a fee if you are a heavier user).

"Just got back from two weeks in India and the Taj Mahal in Delhi was one of the highlights of our stay.  The hotel was immaculate and all the staff were extremely polite, courteous and extremely helpful. For example, the lift operators immediately remembered our floor and swiped their cards to select our floor, gave us a friendly greeting by mentioning our surname each time they saw us. The pool staff were extremely helpful in organising our loungers, covering them with fresh towels and providing water.  But the highlight has to be meeting Chef Mohit and the other members of staff serving at the breakfast restaurant. I was keen to try the Indian breakfast dishes from the buffet and asked advice about what and how to eat. What followed can only be described as total pandering. As",5.0
"Stayed here prior to returning back to the UK Lovely location, beautiful flowers and decor. Upgraded room, unfortunately very small, extremely hot and unable to lower air con below 20 Celsius. Small old fashioned bathroom. Had dinner and breakfast in the hotel. Dinner was a la carte with plenty of choice. Mostly served cold and sorry to say not very good. Breakfast buffet style and very nice. The staff in the hotel were very nice and helpful but I felt tried too hard to please.  This hotel was the most expensive one we stayed in during our India vacation and the expectation was far greater than reality. Sorry but doesn’t live up to the hype and just not worth it.",4.0
"I had the privilege of two stays in a month at Taj Mahal in two of the Taj Club rooms.  Everything from the airport pickup in a smart chauffeured car, to the personal host greeting bypassing the reception straight to the prepared room, to the room, restaurants, bar and gym/spa were impeccable in every way.  While there are signs of significant wear and tear in some parts, the housekeeping teams keep the place in pristine condition.  The beds are superbly comfortable. My frustration with every hotel is their cursory attention to environmental responsibility with the use of single use plastics for toiletries and unnecessary change of linens and towels.   Dining at House of Ming for the breakfast buffet and the Chinese food were amazing.  The Indian food at Varq was competently",5.0

"The moment we entered the hotel it was all mismanagement and the hotel staff was weird and disoriented but later when there was intervention of Mr. Supreet Singh it was a MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION all of a sudden just like what happens in a CINDRELLA STORY. We were given an early check in, followed by lovely cake and bouquet and later on our room was upgraded to suite followed by dine in at the HOUSE OF MING courtesy Mr. Singh. And to top it all we were even given bathing therapy as a complimentary gesture from the hotel itself. The weird staff became very organised, the food was heavenly, hospitality was par excellence and the experience became very pleasant from pathetic. Thank you so much for everything! 🙏",5.0
"I visited this hotel last year to meet one of my friends whom had a residency there. The hotel was lovely and rooms were spacious and clean.  The pool was large, plenty of loungers and each day the attendants would ask me if I wanted to sit in the sun or in the shade. As I’m not one for sun bathing, they would move a lounger and put it under the tees so I could have some relief from the hot Indian sun. They would place and position the towels over the lounger and give me an ice cold bottle of water.  Breakfast was lovely too, a mixture of Indian and international breakfast items, there was a buffet as well as an a la crate menu. The staff at the hotel would suggest places for me to visit both in Delhi and in the wider area. I booked my trips to Agra, Jaipur and Amritsar through",5.0
"The Taj Mahal hotel is an icon, gracing a beautiful green neighborhood of New Delhi with wide boulevards and stately homes. This hotel has been around for a long time and even though it is in the process of a beautiful makeover and facelift, it is by far the best choice to experience home away from home. The Taj staff has raised the bar on customer service and care. Every staff member I encountered was extremely polite, courteous, friendly, efficient and helpful. It seems like a whole lot of compliments but believe me, they do deserve it.

"We stayed at Taj Mahal Hotel in Dec 2019 for one night and had a horrible stay, which was completely their staff's fault (they even admitted it), but they refused to refund the room rate.   We checked in late night after 1 am because of our flight being delayed and the check-in staff knew we were staying with kids and that I had requested non-smoking room, but still the staff gave us a smoking room! When I entered our room at 1:30 am, I found a cramped/tiny room, barely enough to fit two adults, let alone 4 people, as is claimed by Taj Mahal hotel on their site and right away I noticed an ashtray in bathroom, which was odd, but I was too tired to connect the dots.

"We spent two separate nights here.  The first night we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a room on the 8th (Club) floor.  The room was good, but the advantage of having access to the food and drink on offer in the Club Room together with breakfast served in the morning made this rating of 5 stars deserved.  However, on our return a couple of nights later we had a room on a lower floor and felt the rating slipped rapidly down to 4 stars, due mainly to our experience of the Indian restaurant.   The food was of a reasonable standard but the service was slow despite not being very busy, and the music was intolerable - unless you like hearing the same Richard Clayderman track played back to back for an hour.  We were told it was not possible to stop this music as it was being piped",3.0

There are a lot of toiletries!  On our first return, Dinesh swiftly checked us in and, on noticing that I had a severe cold, he arranged for hot water, lemon and honey to be delivered to our room.  On return to the hotel after dinner we went to the lounge for tea. Amit was very helpful in the lounge and when I left early he gave my family two cups of hot toddy for me to have.

Then they would disappear and the service would slow down and finally at the end of the lunch they crowded around for tips!!  This has never happened in our years of going to the hotel.

Ceiling was dirty and the air conditioning vents weren’t cleaned properly (there was visible grit in the vests). It’s a shame if I can point out all such points being a guest at the restaurant, think that eye for details is missing from HK and team engineering.   I was greeted by a hostess on my ingress and she seemed busy with something already. I respect that however, after waiting for them to be free, there was no one who greeted us warmly or ushered us until a while. The managers of the restaurant are sad, wherein he only difference between them and the staff is the uniform. That",4.0

Having just arrived from the airport we were pleased to receive a courteous and concise welcome, check-in and room orientation. Our room overlooked both the Presidential Palace and India Gate.

After a 24-hour journey, we were taken directly to our room to check in, which was a lovely and unexpected treat after a very long day of travel.

It is definitely due for some renovation, though, as the room is tired and in need of updating - small bathroom with a nasty (ugh) bidet, chipped porcelain in the sink, 1970s HVAC where it takes a long time to get a room temperature that isn't either freezing cold or warm and humid, that sort of thing. They seem to do a lot of big events here, which I'm sure is a great money-maker...but we didn't enjoy having to listen to loud, annoying music all night from whatever was going on out back during our stay (on a weeknight, no less....), so it really detracts from what a hotel like this is supposed to",3.0

"While it is obvious that the Taj Mahal Hotel is one of the grand old hotels of New Delhi, it seems the rooms could use some updating. The public areas were spacious and nicely decorated in traditional style, but our Deluxe room was not very spacious and both the room and the corridor from the elevator to the room had a decidedly musty smell, which we assumed indicated that the carpets were old and need to be changed. The bathroom itself was also on the smallish side. In all we found the room to be average and not what we were expecting from a hotel with such a high rating.

But the room I stayed in this time had been recently renovated and was very comfortable.  The club rooms also have  a great view of the Rashtrapati Bhavan gardens.   The food at Varq was mediocre. The service as in most Taj hotels was excellent . But I wonder nowadays if Taj believes that mediocrity in products can be made up by superb service.

For a short business trip I would prefer the ITC Maurya and for a luxurious leisure stay I would try other hotels such as The Leela or the Imperial.,4.0

"The hotel is older compared to its sister Taj Palace. It seems as though it has not changed for the past 15 years while the rest of the world has.  It is situated near where all the embassies are so it’s pretty safe.   It takes about 50 minutes from the airport to get to the hotel. When you enter, you’re greeted by a ornate lobby which is beautiful decorates and majestic.  Breakfast is served at the machan restaurant and is pretty good. It is not advisable to drink water out of the tap in india and only drink bottled water which the hotel provides in your room daily.  The rooms leaves much to desire as it is pretty dated and just adequately furnished.     Guess it is okay if u’re here for business for just a day or two.",3.0

We agreed, and that food trolley was transformed into a cozy table for two. That was a small touch but it really enhanced our in-room dining experience!

Stayed here for 3 nights recently on a business trip to Delhi. It’s the grand old dame of Delhi hotels whose grandeur is fading but a few a sparks stills exist.   Was in a room overlooking the pool and surrounding areas. Room was ok but furnishings and decor was old and dated. Some thing starting to fray. Shower was old style but clean. Toilet again same thing. The decor of the bathroom needs a refresh but it was all clean.   Bed comfortable but nothing great about the room. Came in on 2 nd night to find a smell in the room called room service but took them almost 30 mins to send someone up who wasn’t equipped to deal with it.

"This is definitely a great hotel and it’s usually of a decent value for money.  Why I would recommend it: - Extremely polite but not annoying personnel  - live music in the lobby - good rooms with very comfortable beds and mattresses  - all what you might need in the room, including toothbrushes  - great restaurants (I don’t know are there other restaurants of this level in the neighborhood - I haven’t seen any)  Weaker aspects: - no metro nearby (at least I didn’t see it) - some elements of the decor and equipment are quite old, including room light management and shower. Not annoying, but you might expect something else.   Overall - I like it",5.0

My check-in was completed in my room, that's a first! The view from my room was great and soothing. A nice swimming pool, beautifully manicured gardens, leafy areas beyond the hotel premises. Several restaurants within the hotel. Would want to stay here again.",4.0
Taj groups of hotels are famous for their hospitality and Taj Mahal is not an exception. The overall experience from cleanliness to room qualtiy to breakfast spread to location - you can't go wrong with Taj. We've stayed here for a week and was absolutely delighted with the comfort and hospitality.,5.0

"I had a good deal on Expedia for flight and hotel, I travel every week especially Bangalore and Delhi. I first stayed in a Taj in 1990 so I know the chain well. The location is central but tranquil. I used a few of the restaurants, the buffet was excellent, the Chinese was very very expensive for the quality. What makes this and all of the other Taj hotels special is the caring staff. Attentive,  but not overly so, a genuine desire to serve rather than a tip driven desire. My ""room associate "" was outstanding. Loved my stay and ill be back soon.",5.0
"Spent a night with my family as a weekend getaway at this lovely hotel. Dining at the Varq was the highlight. The traditional biryani which was recommended by the Thomas was the cherry on the cake. The service was excellent. The rose tea post lunch was a just the perfect way to end the lunch. A pat on the back to Thomas Regi who took such good care of us. Scope of improvement- 1) no evening service given to the room 2) service at the pool side could have been better. Recommendation - 1) rooms on the 11th floor has incredible. 2) dine at Varq.  Overall, great experience. It is a hotel with fine taste and good location.",4.0

"I don't have any specific complaints, and I didn't pay for my stay myself - work took care of it. The public areas are grand and opulent, the rooms are ok. I think they have been somewhat modernised - the control panel at the bedside is excellent... you can open and close the curtains while lying in bed, which I loved! But the bathroom is still outdated, and the aircon isn't great - I found it blew straight on me as I was working at the desk. And of course, room service prices are obscene - but Khan Market is a short walk away with gazillions of eating options. Breakfast is fantastic (love that home-made baked yoghurt!). The gym is very good and the attendant gave me a much-needed and wonderful stretch after my workout. The pool is also fabulous for doing laps.",4.0
"I booked to stay at this hotel last weekend with my daughter. Found it confusing to book a room online so called the hotel and spoke to Shajahan who was so efficient, I had the confirmation mail before I'd even disconnected the phone! We were given a room on the Club floor which was convenient only because Machan was so crowded at breakfast time that instead of waiting in the lobby, we had the option of eating in the Club Lounge. Of course the variety was limited but it was compensated for by the gracious staff, especially Pallavi Bisht.  Check in and Check out were smooth and the staff, room service etc was efficient without the mandatory polite PC most hotel staff indulge in. Thank you Taj for a comfortable stay.",4.0

I went to Macha an in April at Taj Mahal hotel and tried farsi Sallie boti meat that was awesome and a unique recipe on its own.At late night they need to maintain temperature since they only lowered the temperature only when I told it was so horribly hot.It was overall an awesome amazing experience at Macha an.But they didn't let me visit their pool area as they told it was night and their pool area was closed. So I could not see their pool area.It was a good dining experience as I tried their Sallie boti oldest signature farsi dish. But they need to improvise more techniques to keep the environment and night time busy as the footfall is not so high at late night.This hotel and its Macha an restaurants are significantly signature places to be visited as a family or friends with,4.0
"While not a classic hotel (the building dates back to the mid-1990s) the Taj Mahal oozes old world opulence and charm.  The lobby is quite grand with fresh flowers everywhere and musicians playing throughout much of the day.  The service is superb - we were greeted upon arrival by staff who took us directly to our room - no need to line up at a registration desk.  There are staff everywhere to help you during your stay from elevator attendants, to pool side waiters to front doormen who will get you a cab.  We found the service everywhere to be excellent but not overbearing.  Our room (307) wasn't large (two smaller beds) but comfortable, extremely quiet and with everything you need for a good stay (the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries, etc.). There is master control by",5.0
"We had not initially planned to stay at the Taj Mahal, but when our original hotel let us down and cancelled our three night booking the Taj Mahal was allocated to us by our travel agent and it did not disappoint. Set in a pleasant garden in the heart of New Delhi, a short stroll from India Gate and Khan Market, the Taj Mahal is in an excellent location. All the staff we encountered from Front of House and housekeeping were extremely nice and efficient. There is a pool in the grounds where you can take a dip and a break from the heat of an Indian summer. The only down side is that you have to walk through reception to get to it as the lift does not go all the way down to the pool level, so you either have to walk past everyone in a damp costume or change in a small dressing room",5.0
"This is my fourth stay at this excellent property in New Delhi.  Its location is superb in an excellent part of the city.

This was an intense meeting with deliberations and discussions from 9 to 6..international and national subject matter experts had gathered here to take some crucial discussions about the future of HIV surveillance in India.

The in-house store has some beautiful saris and the staff is happy to explain the different styles and while I was at the hotel there was a fabulous sari pop up store from a Tata subsidiary. The lobby is beautiful and always full and the service by the front desk and laundry is terrific.

There is no friendly bar, just a dark soulless bar in the corner of the main entrance.

The service is incredible. Definitely felt like 5-star service here. There were a few hiccups here and there (e.g. trying to order drinks at the pool) but on the whole, we've been well-taken care of.   There's a lot of security - I'm not used to having to walk through a metal detector every time I need to enter the hotel so that's kind of annoying.

Secondly, when we allocated a free room I noticed no complimentary water ( unlike other hotels on our tour), I can't remember the cost of water in your room but it was probably in line with the other costs of food and drink in the hotel which although they were good they did not justify the eye watering cost like others have pointed out.

It’s location is fabulous in a quiet area of New Delhi and close to Khan Market and some great boutique shops. It’s around 30 minutes to the airport.  I must say the ground floor lobby is delightful- not the usual counter checkin but rather lovely service desks. See pics.   All the bars and restaurants are located off the Lobby.  We ate at the Japanese restaurant called Wasabi. Wonderful food.  See seperate review.   The staff are all very professional and friendly and there’s even a lift attendant.  The rooms are small by other hotel standards but beautifully comfortable bed linen and pillows.   Would stay here in a,5.0
Stayed for 4 days for business. This is an old hotel but well maintained. The room was good in space. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful especially the housekeeping and at the restaurants. Free Wi-Fi is available as well.  I had two small issues during my stay but the management showed extremely professional attitude in handling and fixing these issues on spot. Very well done.  My only problem is they fixed shower as I prefer movable one.,5.0
"The Taj is known for its ambience and service, and it does live up to its reputation.  From the moment you travel through the security inspection at the entrance gates, you feel as though you have been transported into another dimension.  The service is on key at every point of contact with the staff.  The security at the hotel is palpable, but done in a manner that is not intrusive.  The staff are well prepared to meet your needs without being overbearing.   I loved the breakfast buffet, especially when the Sous Chef assisted me in selecting various Indian foods for breakfast.  The staff members were again very friendly and welcoming.   The room and bed were comfortable.  Although the hotel is a landmark, the rooms are classy and fresh.  The amenities are at a 5 star quality",5.0
This hotel was a great start to a 16 Day holiday to Delhi and beyond.  All the staff were super friendly and helpful.  Rooms were a good size.  Breakfast was a stand out with heaps of variety and a made to order menu as well.  The location was great with only a short walk or Tuk Tuk ride to the India Gate and Khan Market - some good restaurants located nearby.  We did have an afternoon tea there which was a bit steep - 590 INR $11.50 AUS for a teabag cup of tea no extras but we eat out  otherwise so was not a great issue.  We were upgraded to this hotel by our travel agent and was so glad we had an opportunity to stay there on our first trip to Delhi.  Thank you.,4.0
"Despite the fact that the hotel has not managed to negotiate  along term lease (and hopefully in 2018 they are tendering with other hotels for the site) --- the service at this iconic hotel is excellent. It is true that the hotel is in need of an urgent face lift, but in the absence of a long term lease one can understand why the promised upgrades have not materialised. I booked a balcony suite with an inter-connecting club room and they were fantastic -- very very regal (though dated). Service was excellent Each hotel restaurant provided great service and excellent food -- this included Machan, Varq and the lounge.  The staff at this iconic hotel must be credited 100% with providing excellent service under difficult circumstances",5.0
"OMG.  The Hotel facilities, Staff and food was Amazing. The personal driver spoke awesome English and was extremely  accommodating.  I will always remember the sights, sounds smell and taste of Beautiful India",5.0
"We are truly thankful to have stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi. After being in a car accident driving from Agra to Delhi, we didn't know what to do and called the Taj.  We had checked out that morning and weren't even supposed to be staying with them that night, but none of that mattered.  Even in the middle of the night the staff were all incredibly kind, helpful, responsive, and warm.  Special thanks must go to all the concierge staff for helping us navigate a scary situation, coordinating our safe return, rebooking missed flights, and making us feel very comfortable. The hotel of course has beautiful accommodations and a truly impressive breakfast spread, which is hopefully all most travelers require from a hotel. But it was the genuine concern and supreme assistance of",5.0
"We only popped in for coffee and a light bite, but the staff were so helpful and friendly, and it was a nice place to spend 30minutes or so.   The cakes are expensive but good!  Well worth it, when you are in the area.",5.0
The Taj in Delhi is a stunning hotel from the lobby to the well appointed rooms. The staff were friendly and accommodating. There is an outdoor pool that is nice and a terrific spa (I had two massages).  The cost for a room at the Taj is comparable to a 3 star hotel in the US and an elaborate breakfast was included. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Delhi.,5.0
"Just name is enough for review.  We stayed here for 4 nights and it was excellent stay. Kids love Machan breakfast.  Everything was up to the standard. Our stay was during Christmas so every day there was some kind of surprise.   Santa Claus was there on . Christmas Eve, Christmas Carol singing by some schoool, Piano and Violist were there.",5.0
"As always, the Taj is haven from the hustle and bustle of any Indian city where they have a presence – and this hotel is no exception. We’d booked club rooms and they were up to their usual excellent standards – although on the smallish side. There was no separate shower in the first room, but we were re-allocated another room the next day. Club lounge was a good respite from the city – and the staff were friendly and courteous. Snacks were not that great and could do with a better variety. Breakfast was an excellent spread as always - but a very rushed and hurried affair.  They clearly need more staff in the mornings – although some of this can be attributed to some very demanding guests!  (It seems that the more money you have in India, the more boorish and unpleasant you’re",4.0
"My husband and I stayed Taji Mahal New Delhi for 4 nights during our lasure travel in Delhi. We arrived Delhi airport at 3am after long flight from Tokyo via transit in Beiging, we were quickly escorted by Hotel car driver. Check in was done in my room, and after 15 minutes later welcome tea and cookies were delivered.  Room: my first room was located 3rd floor facing to city. It was nicely maintained, very clean, and large enough to walkaround. My second room after coming back from Agra was on 11th floor. This room was more luxuary than the first one.  Food: We had breakfast everyday, one lunch buffet (approx 2600 rp plus tax and service fee), room service, and dinner. All meals were perfect. I ordered a couple of soup for late night meal which was delivered in 20 min after",5.0
"My husband and I spent 2 days at this lovely hotel which is far better than it looks on the pictures.  The service was excellent and the facilities perfect.  We were rather tired after our long flight and were quickly escorted to our beautiful room which had a little balcony area overlooking all of Dehli ( when the smog allowed!) The room was large, extremely comfortable and had an amazing bed and all amenities. We had drinks in the bar and although prices are comparable with london prices it was all very nicely presented.  The main plus for me was the lovely swimming pool - a real oasis after busy days negotiating around Old and New Dehli.",5.0
"Our only regret was that we arrived tired from the flight and didn't have more time there. There are many restaurants to explore. Excellent rooms and service. Good location for shopping and sightseeing.   We would definitely stay again, and are interested in visiting more Taj properties in the future.",5.0
"My wife and I just spent 2 nights at the Taj Mahal hotel in Delhi, and we had a truly great time. The hotel is lovely, with everything you need - including a great breakfast buffet. However, the distinguishing feature is the service - from the moment we arrived to our final departure, every single hotel employee that we encountered was courteous, friendly and professional. However, my top award for outstanding service must be given to Shradda and her colleagues at the concierge desk, who were so patient and helpful. Good job Taj! ",5.0
This is a truly wonderful hotel. We’d asked for a car to pick us up at the airport and that pick up went very smoothly. The driver was courteous and a careful driver. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by name. We didn’t have to check in at a desk but were taken straight to our room where check in was completed. Very nice. We then ate a very pleasant meal in the Machan restaurant which is open 24/7. Later that day we had a cocktail and a snack in Rick’s bar which was delightful. The following day we had a beautiful Japanese meal in Wasabi by Morimoto. We tried coffee and biscuits in the Emperor Lounge too which was also very pleasant. Breakfast in Machan was very good with huge choice. We also had breakfast in the room one day which was first rate. They wheel in a,5.0
