"Visited the property for a private dinner for our anniversary. Was amazed by the hospitality and service which were only second to the gorgeous views of take Pichola. The food was delectable and chef was kind enough to accommodate all of our dietary preferences too. Our steward aayush took great care of us, from taking care of our temperature preferences to clicking gorgeous pictures in the property. Couldn’t have asked for better! Thank you team taj. Looking forward to coming back again for more!",5.0
"Where should I start..........I mean we were in a totally different world. The ushering and check in were absolutely spot on. Siddharth at the front desk is well versed with his job and immediately made a great rapport with us. We were made aware of house rules and covid restrictions etc and ushered in our upgraded Palace Room. Then started a dream holiday for a couple of days. Every person went out of their way to make sure every whim and fancy of ours was taken care of. Hemant Singh Chauhan knows his history very well, Pradeep was always proactive and knew exactly what we wanted before we asked for it, Raag was superfluous with his recommendations in the bar, not to forget Lakshya and Chef Manish Joshi and many many more who go on to make this beautiful property a real palace",5.0
"Wonderful service from food and beverage team Ayush Jain,maan singh,vinod and lalit and cheif Chotelal and Ajay in the restaurant was so amaging, and for other service thanks to Manager Pramod as well  From HK Surendra was great asset rest all HK ok still need more briefing IT service need slight improvent and sevice traing is required. Especially wifiservice  Being Taj is my pariwar it is not a complaint against LPU it is just a feedback to improve the service for the guest, since guest is paying very heavy for all our Palcial hotel which need to be taken care minute  Ravindra S & fly belong to Taj pariwar Thankyou",5.0
Just got back from the lake palace. The place is beyond compare. The setting is absolutely magical. It feels like you're in a heritage ship. The lobby and other common areas are beautifully maintained. But I did feel that there should be more sign boards around to guide you to the various teracces and picturesque corners of the palace. They have a 24/7 boat service to take you to and from the property of you wish to venture out.  The staff is courteous and the housekeeping was prompt and good. Except the day we checked in there were no hand and face towels and no foot towel at the tub which caused the bathroom to get wet. Also the towels were very bad and thin quality. The next day we had a better set of towels. Now coming to the food and service in the restaurants... It's just,4.0

Working from home over the internet, as well as online meetings were as convenient as pleasurable.  Overall a great memorable experience. ",5.0
"We stayed at taj lake palace for 2 nights for our 10th anniversary. Everything was fine from the staff to the cleanliness. We had a good time at the property. Just the food was not up to the Taj standards that we expected. We had all the meals included , so everything from the breakfast to dinner was very average. We went to the other properties in Udaipur like udaivillas and Leela, where the food was way better than Taj. So all in all I would only recommend Taj to improve their food.",4.0
"We had the most lovely time at the tan lake palace. The property , accommodations food and service is unmatched. I could testify to that after having been to the other two main properties at lake Pichola, the lake palace is by far the best in all aspects. Their overall hospitality is impeccable and the staff makes you feel extremely at home . We’ve been spoiler rotten with all the pampering and I can’t wait to be back super soon. Special mention to Mr.Pradeep and Mr.Nikhil who assisted us at the restaurant(s) for their attention to detail and personalised care for the guests",5.0
"Right from the first mail from Reservation Desk confirming our bookings to the time we got dropped off at the Airport, every detail about our vacation was very well taken care of... Be it Airport transfers, room selection / upgrades, menu selection, giving tips on how best one can spend their time while at Udaipur.   The way everyone plays their part in creating memorable experiences for the guests is just amazing. The experience called 'Tajness' just grows on you.  Special shout out to Surinder and Gaurav and for making our time very memorable.   While I have been a true loyalist of Taj Hotels for many years, having stayed at many of them across locations, this trip stood out to be the best by any measure.   Thank you, one and all, for making it so very special.  Wah Taj!!!   ",5.0
"This was the first time I stayed there, but definitely not the last. Not only was the palace property breathtakingly stunning, the staff was overwhelmingly hospitable and went above and beyond to make our stay one to remember. The food was also really good and we never left feeling hungry. No two minds about where we're going to stay the next time we are in Udaipur!  Staff names I remember: Ayush, Anil, Narendra, Siddharth, Kaustav, bar staff (forgot his name). I really think every single staff deserves a mention but unfortunately I don't remember all their names.",5.0
"Location is simply outstanding. You cannot get a better view than this hotel in Udaipur. Plus the tag of Taj which gets added raises your expectations after visiting so many of their beautiful properties globally. But, it all ended right there.   A beautiful boat ride from the Jetty to the hotel and a smooth check in  with a royal welcome simply  put us on top of the world when suddenly we were pushed into a state of shock when our rooms did not get ready till 5pm after long drive from our homes.  It was extremely disappointing to see this when we had planned to do so much in that one night of stay in this Taj property.   Pigeons have created a havock in this property and the poor staff is just busy cleaning their litter all around and some portions of the hotel are smelly too.",3.0
"The location is amazing and the experience is memorable. Right from the boatman Chandan to the Welcoming Usher Bhagwaan ji, to Siddharth from reception to Raag and Ravinder at the restaurants the people were exceptional. We were happy to see the familiar Apple pie with Cinnamon Ice cream. The upgrade to Lake View told us what we would have missed otherwise. The place is clean and our requests were attended to even at odd hours. We liked the fact that there at multiple seating spaces across the hotel and one would love to click pictures everywhere. It was hard to reach this place. There was some construction going on due to which the narrow lanes of Udaipur were not the best to reach the jetty. The menu at Lunch and Dinner were almost the same, which could have been made better",5.0
"A beautiful and regal place. The staff rightly announce ""Welcome to the Palace"". The whole island is the Palace. The rooms are bit on the small size, but it is more than made up by the great food. Food is simply outstanding. Service is impeccable. The team provides out of this world service but would like to mention three people specifically; Ms. Rhea from the front desk, and Mr. Nikhil  +Mr Raag from the restaurant.",5.0
"We stayed at the Taj Lake Palace Udaipur for our anniversary, and were honestly underwhelmed by our stay. To begin, the property is beautiful, and the staff are very polite and courteous. We availed of the 4D offer, which includes all meals. The food at the restaurants were great, and the service was impeccable (Kudos to the restaurant staff, sorry I forgot the names!). Check in was smooth, however we were given the room only after 3PM (Check in time being 2PM). The room was beautiful, albeit on the smaller side. But that is okay, since you are in the middle of a lake! The hotel has many terraces and ""Jharokhas"" to sit in and appreciate the lake views, which truly made a wonderful experience.  Now coming to the slightly disappointing experience. We checked in on the day of our",3.0
"People at Lake palace make the difference , The royal luxurious rooms are perfect to relax and enjoy the views it offers.  Food , perhaps the best food offered in Udaipur at any place, every dish has authenticity and sinks down as memeories.",5.0
"Let's start with the more obvious stuff. The hotel was extremely pretty, and the staff was courteous. Check-in was a breeze, and our rooms were beautiful, albeit on the smaller side, despite them being Palace Rooms. Also of note, was the ambience and the general vibe of the hotel. The vast open spaces and live flute music (yes you read that right), made it a very relaxing location to spend the better part of 4 days in. Coming to the service, we were served by Nikhil at Jharokha. He went above and beyond his responsibilities to make us feel comfortable. From the second day, he understood our palettes so well that we loved every dish that he recommended to us. Also from the restaurant, Raag provided impeccable service and made our trip worthwhile. Something I did not expect,",5.0
"This property is an experience that made our stay magical. But as the saying, 'it's the people that make the place', the memories were made for us by their staff who overdelivered. A shout out to AYUSH for the bespoke service. Also a huge thanks to Sidharth and Narendra. ",5.0
"Our stay at Taj Lake Palace has been one of the most beautiful experiences of our lives. I arrived with my parents to Taj and from the beginning and until the end, everything was just perfect. We received a very royal welcome with rose petals being showered upon us. The staffs at the reception were so warm and approachable. Mr Sudarshan (if I may remember his name correctly) accompanied us to our boat on the last day to bid us farewell. It was such a warm and homely gesture. The food was outstanding. The staffs make you feel at home. They catered to my families varied taste by asking for our preferences. They took care of us as if we were their family. On an unfortunate day, I happened to fall sick and they kept asking if they should prepare something so that I can feel better.",5.0
"Taj has always been known for their hospitality. Amid current pandemic, staff has been quite courteous with all challenges . A palace in mid of a man made lake , a grand stay which can give you a feel of Royal family . Special mention to Anil and Abhishek (Jharokha restaurant) , Anil gave a feeling of being home , all the food needs were considered ,polite and humble . We ate so much during lunches that we couldn’t eat dinner , pun intended ( thanks to the hospitality which gave a personalised experience) A must place in India for Luxurious stay .",5.0
"If u will go to Taj lake palace the phrase home away from home  is truely justify. From the entry point to boat ride to hotel to food, the folk dance are unparallel. Special thanks to sudharshan and his colleagues(front office), ayush, ashishek, raag in restaurant and the other team hotel staff for there wonderful hospitality.

Further kudos to the team on site including Navneet, Anjali, Rhea, Iti, Narendra, Sameer, Iqbal (sorry if I missed anyone).

"I have been to about 25 countries and many places within India but, the experience of this Taj is out of the world. From entrance (shower roses on arrival) to exit (hold an umbrella on your head) they go out of their way to provide an experience that is worth every penny.  We were a group of 9. Each of us took a different view room. And totally enjoyed the life in every room to the fullest. The food is like no other place we ate in Udaipur. Finger Licking good. I already miss our time there.",5.0

"Excellent stay. Services and staff are outstanding. Spl Kudos to Ayush in the restaurant who was extremely vibrant with the guests and the way he looked after us is highly appreciated. Covid has impacted the tourists but Taj has maintained its living standards. The standards in restaurant need upgradation. As of now they are giving limited menu and tourists expect a unique and outstanding quity of food, at least equal if not better than the value for money. Simple things like pre-cooked tea, average taste in veg and non-veg dishes. What was surprising was non-availability of common medicines like Omeo. Firstly the reception refused having any first aid box and non-availability of doc. These facilities are bare minimum that I as customer look fwd to. It would not have mattered if",5.0

The evening entertainment is really good - singers and dancers are brilliant and the setting takes you back to what it must have been like in the days when royalty lived here.

"We were a group of two couples and two kids and stayed in palace room from 17-21 Dec.  This one is right off the storybooks... a dreamy iconic palace 270 years old in the middle of the lake with stunning vistas on all sides particularly of the city palace.  The palace is really well maintained despite the restrictions around heritage structures. We could see artisans regularly touching up the minute carvings and delicate wall arts.  The folk dance in the evening was nice. With the pool and spa closes and a very basic gym there wasn't much to do at the palace. So wouldnt recommend more than two nights particularly with kids till the restrictions ease.  Jit from the bar made some outstanding cocktails and customized for our requests every evening.

"We all have that bucket-list of places we would want to visit in our lifetime. And if Taj Lake Palace Udaipur is not on yours , pen it down now !  This iconic property is a historical landmark in Udaipur - where the rulers/maharajahs of this city use to live.  Taj has fully managed to bring a taste of that opulent vibe and grandeur lifestyle  from centuries ago - to the property today. From the boat ride coupled with the rose petal welcome shower,  to the much acclaimed Taj service level - no stones were left unturned.

From the time we landed at the Udaipur to be picked up by the vehicle sent by the hotel till we were left at hotel -  i dont think there was every a moment where we didnt feel special. The welcome was with rose petals falling from the sky and the nice tour of the hotel. The food was amazing and the staff was always keen",5.0
"My husband and I spend the last week here. We were supposed to stay here for 3 days and then moved to another hotel but had to come back here to celebrate Diwali. We are so glad we did. Once you stay here, always everything else seems less, in warmth and in hospitality. The Taj Lake Palace, makes you feel like royalty. The hygiene, sanitization, and protocols are all in place. One thing that they have not forgotten and actually mastered is how to care for people. They are the kindest and most generous people I have met. They make you feel like royalty as soon as you get in till the time you leave.

"The hotel is unique due to being in the middle of Pichola Lake. It is a lovely setting in a former palace. They do bring out the royal treatment when you arrive in your boat to the dock. They drop rose petals down from above as you enter the front door And a gentleman covers you with an umbrella to shade you as you walk to the inside of the hotel.  The hotel and the grounds are lovely, but they need to pay attention to upkeep in some of the rooms.  When we arrived, there was a man outside our room scrubbing the walls from pigeon droppings.  It is a battle there since they have so many pigeons.  It gets down into the 40’as at night. The heat doesn’t work. They know that, but they don’t tell you. We called because the room was so cold and they brought a space heater. We also had",4.0

"We had a wonderful time staying at the Lake Palace and it is in an outstanding location with great service. However, having stayed in Umaid Bhawan Palace and Falaknuma Palace (both outstanding Taj properties) the Lake Palace is not up to this level of service and does not have the same attention to detail.  Having said this, the food at Neel Kamal was superb the menu extensive and the service by everyone outstanding, it is worth mentioning the service of Vijyesh which was truly world class and attention to detail second to none. Disappointingly we did leave this feed back but no one from the Lake Palace sort fit to contact us to clarify or follow up.",4.0

"We ended out tour of India in Udaipur and what a wonderful oases it was. I had see this hotel on a tv travel show and made it a destination. It didn't disappoint beginning with catching the launch for the ride across the lake to be welcomed with rose petals scattered at the entrance from the balcony above. At every turn there are quite places to sit, listen to the tinkling fountains, place chess, read, enjoy a cocktail. There are tiny, candlelit cushioned niches tucked away where you least expect. The buffet breakfast was wonderful, beautifully served and plentiful options in terms of cuisine. The inner court yard and water feature are enchanting with so much to look at. The pool area is stunning with it's views all around the lake, City Palace across the way and the barge where",5.0
"From the boat ride to this island paradise hotel, to the amazing welcome by an incredible staff, to the sheer beauty of the place, and its breathtaking views - it is the greatest!  It should have more than 5 stars.    Ideally, this Lake Palace Hotel should be the last stop on your visit to India.  It is so relaxing, that it is the perfect place to reflect upon all that you have seen and done in your travels.  One should definitely stay at least two nights.  Upon our arrival, we were met by Harsh Gohite, who so warmly welcomed us to the hotel and checked us in.  Then, we were met by the fantastic Anjali Thapa, who gave us a tour of the hotel and took us to our fabulous, immaculate  Room #125, with its stunning lake views of the sunsets over the mountains, and the Monsoon Lake",5.0
We just loved this hotel. Stayed with our two young adult children and we were all blown away by the experience.  The staff are outstanding and the service very attentive but not intrusive.

"My wife and I stayed at the lake palace and it was truly an experience. One of the most unique and magical places we have stayed anywhere in the globe. From the boat ride to the hotel, to the rose petals, the room, the dining, the spa... everything was great. The staff was excellent and we had an experience we will never forget.

"Guests pass security on the deck, where they also take care of the luggage. Then, you take a boat to the hotel, with mandatory life vests.  On arrival, my husband and I  were welcomed with a musician, a dancer, an embroidered umbrella and a shower of rose petals (but the performers aren’t always there).   The lobby, lounges, bar and courtyard are together in an open space, reminding you that this is a palace.  Daily, at 6:00pm there are musicians, dancers and acrobats, until 6:46. All the property is a marble wonder that smells like jasmine.  There are rooms on the ground floor and the first floor, with no elevators, but the stairs are beautiful and  friendly.

Everything about the stay is to give a taste of what it might have been like to have lived there as a royal. A simply unforgettable and don’t miss experience. There are very few places in the world where you can stay in an old palace on an island with private boat transfer, impeccable service, stunning views and a truly romantic setting.  Yes, as other reviews suggest, the bathrooms are a little dated and are not state-of-the art but they do maintain the authenticity of a former palace and are perfectly clean and work perfectly. For those who want a modern waterside experience then there’s the Oberoi, which is directly in front on the shore opposite the palace..BUT",5.0

"I booked 2 nights in Taj Lake Palace Udaipur with very high expectations. Official photography is really beautiful, it was highly recommended by a friend, hotel architecture and setting seemed to be really unique. The truth is that is a nice 250 years old building which´s main attribute is to float on Pichola Lake. Architecture is nice but nothing great compared to other Rajastani Palaces or buildings. Most rooms are set in a two story squared building, open air corridors disposed around a central garden. Garden has really magnificent trees and plants, but is not well maintained, at least to ¨Palace¨ or ¨European¨ standards, however I understand that seasonal changes and harsh climate has a part on it, however more maintenance is needed. Personnel is really up to make your stay",3.0
Loved every moment at this hotel. The arrival by boat and the welcome was great fun and the check-in was quick and easy. On the first night we stayed in a room overlooking the courtyard which was lovely. On the second night we were moved to a lake-view room which was magical. We thoroughly enjoyed drinking cocktails at the bar whilst watching the local dancing and had a great evening meal in the Indian restaurant. When visiting make sure you catch the history tour of the palace - it really brings the place to life.,5.0

"The hotel lives up to its ranking as one of the best hotels in the world. Taj Lake Palace is a converted palace situated in the middle of Lake Pichola. The building is a pristine white that glistens in the lake around it. The entrance to the hotel is through an exclusive pier and a short boat ride.   The palace hotel welcomed us by showering us with rose petals and with friendly smiling faces. The inside of the palace is even more beautiful than the outside, with a courtyard and lovely music, birds chirping, a lily pond and a small garden just makes you want to sit back and relax. It was hard to leave the palace for sightseeing!  What makes the hotel really special is not just the beauty of the property and it’s location, but the people who staff it. They go truly above and",5.0
"This former summer palace is now a palace for the discerning traveller. Built on an island in the middle of a lake, one understands why Udaipur is called the ‘ Venice of the East’. Service is impeccable from the greeting at the boat one takes to the hotel to the time you leave. 3 restaurants with excellent food. As our luggage was lost by the airline, the hotel supplied a  complimentary ‘stress kit’ with pajamas  etc. to get us through. Beautiful garden courtyards lit up by floating candles at night.

"After much excitement planning to stay one of our last nights in this luxury hotel, the overall feeling was a bit disappointing. And it was more that we were missing the authentic touch and flavor of Rajasthan after traveling for many days through Rajasthan. For us it was not worth spending the night here which was our conclusion after checking out. It feels like being somewhere in Italy (Venice or Capri) and once inside the hotel after the traditional welcoming it has this European atmosphere. It did not feel that we were in Udaipur at all. In the evening besides the cultural program, there is not much to entertain besides enjoying your dinner. We had a late dinner in their worldclass nominated restaurant Bhairo but the food was comparable to other restaurants in Europe where i",2.0

"The Taj Lake Palace provides a rare exception to our general view that luxury hotels are not worth the price. While we can afford to stay in luxury hotels we usually avoid them because we often feel ripped off, paying a price that exceeds the value.

What makes this hotel so special is the location, the restaurant on the roof and the staff. However everything about and at this hotel is excellent. Well worth staying at. We were upgraded part way through our stay and both rooms had great views. Rooms are serviced well. Lots of free water. Wi-Fi is ok, but a bit slow. Transfer from the lake edge is from the hotels private jetty and is by hotel boat which is free and ready whenever you want to go back and forth.

Sidharth at reception was a delight and so helpful for anything and everything we needed. The room upgrade we got was also wonderful. The serving staff at the restaurants were immensely considerate... The chef personally came to us and asked us if he could cook something special for the child.

Given the quality of the setting and architecture  it would be easy for the place to rest on its laurels but the food at both of the restaurants we sampled was of a very high quality and the service was affable and attentive.

Yes, it's horrendously expensive, but worth it for a short stay. We didn't leave the hotel whilst we were there, choosing to enjoy everything on offer rather than to go into Udaipur. Afterwards, we transferred to a hotel in town which we used as a base to explore from. This seems a sensible way to go about it (unless you have deep pockets).  The hotel without doubt deserves its plaudits, but I think it's worthwhile pointing out a few things just to keep some sense of perspective.....!  1. It's quite a lot smaller than we imagined.  2.

"We spent two nights at this legendary property. If the Umaid Bhawan Palace is the Maharaja of Rajasthan, then surely Taj Lake Palace is the Maharani - gorgeous colors, romantically appointed rooms, beautiful as a jewel box, to be visited at least once in a lifetime. We had two types of accommodations - a double room with water view, and the second night the Mayur Mahal - Royal Peacock Suite. The room was beautiful, like a small jewel, with a double bed (queen, really), and a richly upholstered sofa. The bathroom is tiny, tiny - if you are two larger sized adults, you might be better off with the suite, which is so otherworldly stunning, that you feel as if in a storybook. Service is top notch everywhere (thank you Raag, for your solicitous catering to my dietary needs), and",5.0

Does Taj Lake even need reviewing? Can you doubt that what you will experience isn't going to be the best of the best? For what you pay you expect not less and in fact it can even be a bit over the top but it is a once in a lifetime experience that if you can splurge to have is worth the romance of it all.,5.0

We dined at the luxurious Neel Kamal restaurant and had a wonderful North Indian meal. A special shout out too Mr. Valmiki too, who was very warm and courteous, helped us in making it memorable. It’s definitely a thing off our bucket list, and we would love to come back again soon.   Raghav & Nikita",5.0

Gazing through the windows in  the breakfast  restaurant you feel like floating on a boat in the water. I stayed in a garden view room.

The boatmen are very sympathetic and make you feel comfortable. They are skilled in making pictures of you and the hotel in the background. Very nice gesture. I  highly recommend this hotel.",5.0

I've stayed there six times altogether, although the first five times were long ago, when the hotel was owned and run by the maharajah, and it was fairly reasonably priced.  It is now run by the Taj group of hotels and is very expensive, but I can honestly say it was worth every penny.  Move heaven and earth to stay at least one night!",5.0

Right from the moment we arrived at the airport, the staff and hospitality was impeccable. Somehow, each member of staff we met wished us happy birthday! The palace has entertainment arranged every evening and a temperature controlled pool, amongst other things. They organized a special private dinner for us on the terrace overlooking the lake.

Apart from this the food, the rooms, the view, the aura, the freshness in the air,  the ambience of the restaurants and the entire premises was truly mesmerizing. Staying at the lake Palace was a very satisfactory experience where nothing was missing and at the same time nothing was overdone.

This hotel is steeped in history and was built as a ""party palace"" for the Maharana family from Udaipur (you can learn about the palace and family history on the highly recommended evening historical walk). We were treated like royalty from the minute we arrived, with umbrellas held over us to protect from the sun and petals showered on us from above as we entered the foyer.

"On a tour of Rajasthan we stayed at this hotel. I had selected this hotel considering it to be the jewel in our choice of hotels across the region. After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures online I was very excited to visit.  On arriving we were met at a jetty and taken to the palace on a small boat. Despite the rain, the palace looked just like the pictures from the distance. However as we approached closer it lost its shine somewhat.   Our greeting and check-in at the hotel seemed rushed and there was a lack of warmth in the staff we met. We were then shown to our room which was small but beautifully designed. We were disappointed by the ongoing maintenance at every turn in the hotel, despite this things seemed very tired. The entertainment in the evening was good",3.0

The booking experience wasn’t great - the lady on the phone arguing over price (the website had a different price to what she was telling me) then haggling over twin beds vs king size beds. Imagine paying SGD 2k/night and suddenly you’ll understand why the haggle over twin beds seems out of place.

I could not recommend this hotel and the staff who work there highly enough. The drivers that did the airport transfer were kind and friendly pointing out sites along the journey.

Always on water taxis. The staff was paying attention getting to know us, finding ways to make our time more special, anticipating needs. There was a mix up in our reservations, Dhankar at front desk kindly worked through it for us and we were thrilled at our upgraded room.

"The white palace in the middle of the Lake Pichola is nothing short of breath taking. It’s a comfortable 6-8 minute boat ride and once off it, you are transported to the Royal era of the days gone by. The rooms were beautiful with ornate wall paintings and pretty views of the other palaces that dot the lake circumference. The bathrooms were a tad bit dated and it took me a good 15 minutes to search for all the light switches in the room. Would have appreciated if we would have been shown to our room by the hotel staff and our attention drawn to the same. The pool area was very picturesque and the whole palace takes on another feel once night sets in. The views from the 2nd floor are quite mesmerising.

Comfortable rooms with a view of the City Palace, an excellent restaurant and superb service - all in the most extraordinary location.

Wonderful building which was the summer palace of the maharajah of the city now a Taj hotel.  You go to the hotel by boat.  Nice interior garden and a wonderful small pool.  The rooms are  furnished a little old but comfortable.  Just try to get a room with a city view.  Have a dinner on the rooftop. This is very romantic and you will have your dinner with a perfect view on the city and lights.  The staff is kind.  This hotel was the set of an old James Bond film. “Octopussy”,4.0
"Our room was a deluxe/standard room but we were lucky enough to get one of the few with a large enclosed balcony on the east side, which has stunning views across Lake Pichola to The City Palace; this is beautifully lit up at night and picture perfect at sunrise!

The bathroom was also suitably luxurious with a good shower.

"Ever since seeing the James Bond film “Octopussy” in the 1980s I have dreamt of seeing (and, if I ever could, actually staying at) that “palace which floats in the lake somewhere in India”.  A recent business trip took me to India and when finding myself with a few extra free days, I decided to book the Taj Lake Palace and finally realize my dream.  The hotel not only met but greatly exceeded my expectations.  Frist, let’s be clear:  this hotel is a one-of-a-kind property that could rest on its reputation and unique qualities.  There’s no place like it anywhere on Earth and they undoubtedly know that, so they could easily cut corners and still attract visitors.

So, expectations couldn't be higher.

The whole hotel, including the rooms and less important public corners, are gracefully adorned with beautiful period furniture. All restaurants are top notch and service there is flawless.

There are a few nit picky things that one could point out but the hotel provided some of the best service I’ve experienced.

"The Taj Lake Palace was a hotel I saw on a TV documentary a million years ago and promised myself to go stay one day.  But when the moment came, some sneaking doubts arose. Should I stay here or should I go to the Oberoi? My heart was telling me, the Taj. My head was telling me, the Oberoi. I went with the heart.  One guide paraphrased the dilemma as ""the Oberoi is a hotel that wants to be a palace and the Taj is a palace doing its best to be a hotel"".  And that is exactly right.  There is no beating Oberoi in luxury hotel management.  In terms of client service, property management and resort-style luxury experience, it is miles away from the competition.  That, in my experience, is the honest truth.  However, if you are value the location, the character, the sense of history,",5.0

Rooms are probably the ""less"" amazing part of the stay. Although perfectly fitted with everything you expect, they are quite small and if you don't book a lake view, these rooms are even smaller.

"I wanted to treat my wife to the best possible experience among the Taj hotels in India. We had been to the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur and the Faluknama Palace in Hyderabad, so are familiar Inner Circle travelers amongst the Taj Palaces.  This is definitely an ultimate splurge experience in Udaipur, where Lake PIccola centers the old Mewar maharanas social and political center. Expect to stay on the island where the Palace is located; there's nothing much in the town, except City Palace and other hotels. I strongly suggest a suite and the Mewar Experience rooftop dinning. Make sure to watch your timing to catch the sunset fully. ",5.0
We stayed 3 nights last week and thoroughly enjoyed our time. We changed rooms to a larger one and it was beautiful and not a problem for the hotel. The staff are so lovely and helpful.

"We decided to end our honeymoon journey through Rajastahn with a night at the Taj Lake Palace and we could’t have had a better experience. Everything was perfect! From the boat ride and the grand welcoming with rose petals falling from the sky to the magic breakfast and the small details as the rememberance gift at our departure. The staff, especially client manager Prathiba and our floor butler made our stay extra special by being the most helpful and friendly people. We got upgraded (!) to a suite and it was like staying in a museum. Breathtakingly beautiful. We had our dinner at the indian restaurant and the thali was totally amazing.

This wonderful hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. From the moment one arrives at the landing stage to be ferried across to the hotel one is cocooned in luxury. We got there at night tired after a long day and were greeted with the royal umbrella and rose petals followed by being greeted by beautiful Rhea and a welcome drink. Our room was gorgeous and the bed separated into twin beds for us . The attention to detailby housekeeping is astonishing.

Next morning the rest of my party went to explore Udaipur and as I wasn’t well, I stayed behind.  The staff couldn’t have been kinder, from Angeli who found me a cool,quiet spot to sit, to Sandeep who brought me a bottle of salt, sugar, lemon solution to sip.  Well the solution worked because I was able to join my friends later in the afternoon.

"India is a land of contrasts. The ride into Udaipur from the airport is fairly typical - about an hour rattling down a road that is either being renovated or destroyed, you can never tell in India. The center of the town is grim with a honking traffic snarl, until your driver turns off into a secluded entryway leading to a boat launch. Uniformed staff handle your bags, the boatman distributes the life vests and the boat purrs off the short crossing to the Lake Palace. Falling rose petals, cold drinks and the traditional bindi await. It really is another world. Actually, it's unreal. You're on an island surrounded by teeming India. We had Room 101, a quiet corner room that looks across the lake to the illuminated City Palace. We ate one night in the Indian restaurant (I recommend",5.0

There are plenty of places to sit and view the incredible scenery and to soak up the ancient history of the amazing history of Udaipur.  The Palace on shore is well worth a visit as is the Summer Palace in the lake.  The Dining Room offered an excellent buffet or arla carte.

"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel until the moment I checked out. The rate they charged me at check out was almost 10% more than what I was anticipating. Rather than acknowledge and apologize for the misunderstanding, I spent 2 months trying to come to a resolution that I thought would be fair. They ignored me, and then they went behind my back to tell my travel agent to tell me there is nothing that can be done. This is not how I would expect to be treated by a hotel where I spend thousands of dollars. Never again.",1.0

After arrival by boat shuttle we were greated by a rain of rose petals. Upon check-in we were lucky and got an upgrade to a historical suite. The suite was just amazing and had a phantasic view over the lake. Every staff member was so heartwarming friendly and attentive, what made us almost feeling like royals.

It was, for me, love at first sight.   The staff were impeccable. Simran especially, with her elegance and warm gracious manner. The lush gardens a serene calm in a city storm.

Udaipur is stunning to begin with, with the fort and city palace overlooking the Lake--and the lights sparkling on the water at night.

The overall experience was first class, and it is understandable why heads of state, film stars, and similar people stay here, especially considering the seclusion and security of the hotel. We booked direct with the hotel, and communications were simple and efficient. We used their transport service to pick us up from the small Udaipur airport. The process was effortless. We handed over our luggage and it arrived in our room. We were delivered to the hotel boat for the 5 minute transfer across the lake to the hotel reception. The small boats run on demand are plentiful, so never had to wait. The hotel only allows residents to visit the hotel, so you can only arrive by their boat, so another way to keep it exclusive and secure. A great experience",5.0
