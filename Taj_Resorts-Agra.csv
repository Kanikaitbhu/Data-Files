"Great Hotel, well positioned for the Taj. Really pleasant and helpful staff. Fantastic shop on lower floor. Stayed there 2 years now and will definitely stay again when in Agra. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5.0

"When you are at Agra what are the most important things you look for?  1) A stay closest to Taj with a view of Taj from rooftop 2) A hearty welcoming host and sincere advisory  3) Good ambiance and food   You get all 3 here with A+ scoring. Most importantly the host. Yes, I must mention Mr. O.P Yadav, the GM. Please refer to him for anything you need and surely he'll be of help, including arranging your Agra sightseeing at the cheapest possible cost.   What you get as a bonus is the puppet show, the live music and live artwork of traditional Sufi or Mughals from people who actually belong to the same dynasty who made the Taj Mahal. Isn't is awesome! Even if you don't buy their items, the making of the art work at the hotel is worth seeing.   I stayed with my family including my",5.0

"Me and my wife stayed at Hotel Taj Resorts for 3 nights and we had an amazing time there. Brand new installations, staff very polite, great restaurant and pool area. Only few minutes away from Taj Mahal. Highly recommend Hotel Taj Resorts",5.0
"Spent a few days in Agra viewing the Taj, fort and other main sites with a guide. The hotel is comfortable and great value, rooms are clean with all amenities, pool and restaurant, the view from upstairs is amazing. Staff are very helpful, we had to book extra nights with no problem. Downstairs at the hotel is a gem of an artwork shop, authentic marble goods at a reasonable price - plus a huge variety of local fashion clothing. The staff in the shop can explain the origin of all pieces - highly recommend buying from Vimal and his team. We stayed away from the tourist shops outside the Taj!!! The restaurant food is great accompanied by live authentic Indian music most nights - a bonus...",5.0

"We had a very pleasant stay at the Taj Resort hotel. Delicious breakfast and the rooms are a good size with a fridge, comfortable beds, bathroom and everything else you need. The rooftop has a good restaurant but also a terrace to relax and overlook the Taj Mahal. Very nice that we could just walk to the Taj Mahal. The staff at the reception and from housekeeping are very friendly and treat their guests with respect and provide good service.  We were lucky that we arrived at the hotel just before Mr Trump visited Agra, because otherwise we would not be able to visit this wonder of the world. The staff tried to make sure we could enjoy our stay in Agra even where the city was taken over by the authorities. ",5.0
Great hotel within walking distance to the East Gate. Couldn’t have asked for a better located hotel.   We took an evening stroll to check out how far the Taj East Gate was and felt very safe.  Very helpful staff. Wish we could have stayed longer.,5.0

"It is on the well paved road to the Taj Mahal so very nice access. Good reception,  modern art and rooms. Friendly staff. They arranged our private transfers to and from Delhi quickly and cheaply. It is a dry hotel due to Taj Mahal proximity but this can be remedied. Rooms comfortable,  breakfast fine. Good value for money. ",4.0
"Location is very suitable for anyone who would like to enjoy the beauty of Taj Mahal at different times of day as it is just walkable from the hotel, can view from the hotel roof top itself. We stayed 2 days at the hotel and enjoyed the beauty of Taj Mahal in the early morning as it is just walkable from the hotel. Anil driver picked us and dropped us to the Delhi airport and he took us around which helped us a lot. He was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good and the food and staff at the roof top restaurant was friendly and accommodating. Hotel staff Yadavji and everyone was very friendly and made our stay wonderful and memorable.

"We chose this hotel as it was within walking distance of the Taj Mahal.  The room was basic but clean.  The staff were friendly and helpful, it was good value for money.  There was a festival on a few minutes walk from the hotel which was great, the hotel is very central.    There is a lovely shop in the basement where you have breakfast.  You can see how the various marble artifacts are inlaid by a man and his son.  Very skilled work and interesting to see how it is done.",4.0
"This is a reasonable choice if you want to visit the Taj Mahal. 20 minute walk. Rooms are clean, staff are helpful, bed is comfortable and the food is OK. Advertises a bar but this does not exist. Overall OK you could find better at the same price but its proximity to the Taj was our motivation for staying. Would we go back  ?  Maybe.",3.0

"We stayed here 3 nights Jan 30- Feb 1. I agree with another review that says this is a well-run hotel and they also have an efficient front-desk service. Quite impressed. They helped us book our flight from Delhi to Amritsar on the classy domestic carrier Vistara...they also arranged for the hotel taxi to take us on a 4-hr ride to Delhi Airport to catch the flight. They arranged for their hotel taxi to take us to a private bank to get Indian Rupees on a 3-day holiday weekend. We had a pile of laundry that was done by end of the day. Breakfast buffet hours were good for those who have a tour or flight to catch. If you don’t already have a tour booked- they can help you. Even our tour guide said that this is a pretty good hotel- he often picks up tourists from here. And, it’s",5.0

The staffs are so friendly and helpful.  We are so impressed with the warm welcome and hospitalitiy fron Mr Singh, the owner of the hotel, he shared with us a lot about culture.

Hotel is well located within 700m of the Taj Mahal.  Room was very comfortable and clean with hot shower. A delicious breakfast was included.  Staff very helpful and accomodating. Although it was too cold to swim the rooftop pool looked very inviting.,4.0
"Room was okay, although the bathroom needed improvement. But the staff were extremely pushy and it made us feel uncomfortable.  When my partner and I arrived, the owner grabbed my hand and wouldn't let go so I was forced to listen to him for a good 5 minutes. Straight away he was explaining to me how his art gallery was supposedly selling art for way cheaper than anywhere else in Agra. This was literally upon arrival and he was already trying to sell me some stuff. The same situation occurred throughout our stay : we were constantly pressured to go to the art gallery to buy souvenirs. They even made it so you HAVE to walk through the art gallery to go to the breakfast area. We had the same situation with a puppet show every night, the performers would literally trap you in the",2.0

"This is a compact property half a mile from the Taj. It is in a no vehicle zone, so you wont be able to park your car right at the property. Rooms are mid sized, very clean, and the rooftop restaurant is very good, with live music and good food. Breakfast is average quality but will do the job. The front desk management is very friendly and helping. Recommended.",4.0
Hotel and Hotel staff are reasonable. The location of the hotel is good.  But we had a bad experience and defrauded worth Rs  6000.00 by the local Taxi drivers. Will not visit this city again. But not the Hotel fault.,4.0

"After booking this some time ago, I came back to read the reviews on this place and was a bit worried - thinking we would be staying in a tired, unwelcoming hotel. We found the opposite - very welcoming staff, accommodating and friendly.  The room was fine, was worried about the bathroom but that was fine too (picture of shower added). It is a well used hotel but it is clean and has everything you need. The other reviews are scathing and need to be taken with a pinch of salt; don’t come here with your western ideals - we are in India and in comparison to its surroundings this hotel performs well.  The food in the restaurant is also great - definitely recommend the garlic naan and chicken tikka masala.  I would recommend this hotel for a quick stay next the Taj Mahal as it’s",4.0

What a wonderful stay we had. The hotel is ideally placed to visit the Taj Mahal. It is within walking distance to the ticket office and ultimately the Taj Mahal. Roof top restaurant is great for all year round with heaters provided . Food freshly prepared and really tasty. I recommend the butter chicken.The bedrooms are comfortable being air conditioned and quiet. I wouldn’t hesitate to go back. We had a problem with out taxi transfer (Hoppa ) and the hotel manager was truly brilliant sorting things out. ,4.0
"Beautiful foyer and welcoming staff. There is also a roof top restaurant and terrace with swimming pool although sadly too cold to swim in early February! Food is good and there are tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We had rooms on the basement level so there were no windows but the rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Staff were lovely.  My only slight gripe is that there were no instructions for operating the safe or TV, both of which required a call for staff to come and set up, also no hairdryer.",4.0

"I stayed here for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Room was reasonably large with a king size comfortable bed. Foyer is very welcoming as are the staff. Breakfast was buffet and quite extensive. Dinner menu was a mix of Indian & western. Bar is just off the foyer & alcohol is served in the restaurant.

"We stayed one nighr at Hotel Taj Resorts Agra. We were booked into another hotel but was very dissapointed on arrival. We went to Taj resorts and they were very helpful and booked us a room. The room was very clean and comfortable, bed linen and bathroom towels crisp and clean. Tea and coffee making facilities along with tea, coffee and water in the room. Dinner on the roof top restaurant was fabulous with views of the Taj Mahal. This hotel is perfectly placed for visiting the Taj Mahal, it is literally 10 minutes walk along a very pleasant, paved walkway straight to East Gate entrance, would highly recommend for visitors to Agra.",5.0
"Only good this about this hotel is location near Taj Mahal but rest of this is very bad. we requested high floor room and they gave us BASEMENT ROOM. never seen anywhere basement room with no window feel like i am in prison surrounded by only walls.we requested to change room but receptionist was rude and didn't listen our request, there was welcome traditional dance by a kid in lobby and room was under the lobby so i was keep listening his foot step like someone knocking hard on sealing. there is fake window but there is nothing behind it just a hole in wall.Bathroom sink was blocked i am attaching pictures of horrible room.

This place is such great value for money. The service is great. The rooftop bar and food is amazing and best of all it’s 5 minutes from the Taj Mahal. Really enjoyed our stay! This hotel does it serve alcohol so you must try their sweet lemon soda. Delicious!!,5.0
"Staff was very helpful to meet all the needs we expressed. Laundry service was excellent and cheap. American breakfast with a live omelet chef and french toast was welcome after days of Indian cuisine. Easy walk or 50-rupee rickshaw to the Taj Mahal. Comfortable, large bed, and a shower with a glass half-wall and a shower curtain, which hardly ever appears in the India I have traveled in. TV was TOTALLY impossible to operate. Two remote controls, and it kept shifting to TATA, a pay per view network, wanting us to subscribe. Someone from staff tried to teach us how to use the remotes, and HE could get free channels, but not us. We were not interested in TV anyway.",4.0
"Service provided by staff was exceptional. They arranged a pick up from the train station in the middle of the night at the last minute which was much appreciated.

"My husband and I spent 1 night in Agra with the singular intent of visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise. This hotel was overall perfect for that purpose. The rooftop restaurant served delicious food and the shop in the basement with a live demonstration on marble carving and semi-precious stone inlay art was very nice. We also enjoyed the complementary breakfast buffet! The room itself could have used a little TLC. There were several minor cosmetic issues and the mini fridge didn’t work, but those things didn’t really bother us because it was only one night and everything seemed pretty clean despite there being obvious wear and tear to the room. I would recommend the Hotel Taj Rasorts to anyone wanting to stay at a clean, budget friendly hotel close to the Taj Mahal. ",4.0
"Mr JM Singh and all the staff at this wonderfully located Hotel (yes, within walking distance of the Taj Mahal!) gave us a warm Indian welcome and attentive and helpful service, including reception, restaurant (Hakim Singh) and basement emporium, offering authentic Agra merchandise.

I stay here for two days.It was a very pleasant experience for us.The hotel is very near to Taj Mahal and it's ambiance is very good.The rooms are good.Breakfast is complementary and it has a variety of dishes.There was an arrangement of live gazal program during dinner in the roof top restaurant and it is really very romantic.   Only thing I did not like is I am allotted a room in basement so it has no window otherwise everything is fine.My advise during booking please ask for a room with window if available.  I recommend the hotel without second thought.  BR Suman Gupta,5.0

"This hotel is all about the location as per previous reviews, the Taj Mahal is literally 5 minutes up the road and that is the only reason it gets an average mark from us. The general staff and the reception we great and helped us with a few queries (thankyou) but unfortunately this hotel does however fail a bit in customer service in regards to dining.  We arrived around lunchtime for a two night stay to do both sunset and sunrise at the Taj so before going out we thought we have a quick snack on the rooftop bar/restaurant. After waiting around 30 minutes (nobody around but bar/restaurant open according to reception) someone appeared and took our order. The food arrived about another 20 minutes later COLD...not a great first impression. After we'd been to the Taj we thought we",3.0

"Checked in expecting Taj's famous hospitality that I had come to appreciate at all of their locations in India but this one was a huge let down. The staff could do better when it comes to hospitality and services. The breakfast was a huge let down as all Indian food was either oily, salty or downright tasteless. The egg station needs a trained chef and so does the bakery (muffins were under and croissants were over-baked)",3.0
"This was an average hotel, although to proximity to the Taj Mahal was awesome. We were like an 8 minute walk, which allowed us to be some of the first people there. There is a rooftop which was nice, but it doesn't have a view of the Taj Mahal. Also if you are more than 2 to a room you should book 2 rooms instead of trying to fit into 1. We had 4 people in a room, as the website said that was possible but one person ended up sleeping on a couch and the other had to sleep on a bed that was brought in. The bed brought in ended up being a cardboard table with a cushion placed on top of it. Not the most comfortable, so I would recommend getting 2 rooms instead of trying to squeeze into 1 as their rooms do not accommodate more than 2 people. ",3.0

"We tried to search for hotels that had a view of the Taj Mahal when we came across this hotel. Pictured was a rooftop view, which we were unable to actually see. On the plus side, the staff was friendly and the live music was incredibly charming. Food was great! They offered a puppet show which was so thoughtful (my daughter was too exhausted at the time though) The room itself was about what you’d expect for the price, but our room in particular had that 3-day old damp laundry smell (And feel), and I had a hard time getting comfortable enough to sleep because of that. The shower had the bare minimum of amenities and soaps, so be wary of that. It was also smaller than I imagined, and wasn’t very cozy either. The TV had almost no watchable channels, and kept displaying the cable",4.0

"We visited Agra over the 1st weekend of Jan 2020. The plan was to be leisurely with the itinerary and probably stay the night at Agra. The Taj Resorts came in recommended by colleagues at work.  The place is hardly a 5 minute walk from the Taj Mahal parking compound. Reaching there we were pleasantly surprised to find a cozy, well maintained place with adequate parking and a very serviceable reception.   We reached there around 7 PM and it seemed like the shift end for the Front desk executive. Nonetheless he greeted us with eagerness and made us welcome even at that hour.  The hotel is very nice with above average rooms. It has a good restaurant (although we did not try it but went out to a restaurant for meals). At the basement, there is also a section where artisans are",4.0
"My wife and I (both British) were due to spend two nights in Agra (7-8 Jan 2020). Our Goan travel agent had booked us into the Sheela Inn, which was dreadful. We therefore spent our 1st night in the Ganga Ratan, which was scarcely better. We then chose the Taj Resorts for our 2nd night. It's a small hotel, but very-well run, with nice air-conditioned en-suite rooms, an outdoor pool and more than one on-site restaurant. It is a few hundred metres from the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel .... With one caveat ... They don't serve alcohol. If you're looking to stay in Agra and are watching the pennies, I recommend NOT settling for less than a 4-star hotel. Your health, safety and sanity might be at risk, if you penny-pinch  in Agra.",4.0

Stayed here New Year’s Eve and was very underwhelming for how much we paid. It is In a good location close to the taj but the quality of the rooms and the service was not worth the price. Would have been much better off staying a bit further away and getting transport to the taj,3.0

This was our best hotel experience we have had in our trip through india. The head manager was in contact through what’s app and arranged our pickup at the train station. The hotel was very clean and the staff was willing to accommodate and assist us with anything we needed. As soon as we walked up to the hotel we were greeted and our luggage was picked up right from our car. Everyone was smiling and cordial. They greeted us with something to drink and got us to our room. The rooms were very nice with everything that you need to be comfortable. The hotel restaurant was also excellent in food quality. The roof top from the highest point has a very nice view of the Taj Mahal as well. The next day we walked to the Taj and it only took 7 minutes. They held our bags after check-out,5.0
"Being a veteran of TA, I always knew to read the negative reviews and to look at the positives with some skepticism when there are thousands of them. This time, while my instinct told me this may not be our type of of hotel, I went with it because of its proximity to the Taj and the various comments regarding rooftop having a view of the Taj. And I thought how bad could it be if there are still a decent amount of seemingly real positive reviews. Well, lessons learned. Not since my poor college student days have I stayed somewhere that made me cringe this much. It is truly tired and run down. The shower head was moldy and disgusting. Stains on all things, sheets, towels, pillows. Hotel smelled of cleaning agents that borders on vinegary. I literally slept with towels under and",1.0
"The Hotel definitively needs a renovation! The rooms are very small, old and filthy and there is no window to open. In the bathroom there is water leaking (bathtube onto floor/ toilet shower). It was also extremly loud; noise from nextdoor guests. The rooms are overprized; I paid more than 100 US Dollars per night for a deluxe room, which was definitively NO deluxe room! Restaurant overpriced! The only good thing was the breakfast buffet. A horrible xmas stay for us! Picture shows the window of our room that was not to open and covered with condensed water.",1.0

"We arrived by train and took a taxi to the hotel which is a 5min walk from the Taj Mahal. First impression of the hotel is good, nice recpetion  and polite staff. However on arrival at room our excitement bubble was burst. The rooms are dated and very wooden. The view from our room was of horses getting mistreated when used for carrying around fat tourists which was awful to see. The bed was comfy but the WiFi was awful and could only get a signal by the door. Food on the rooftop was actually really good and the swimming area looked OK but too cold to swim. The biggest issue was the noise at night with banging and crashing due to heavy doors and solid floors. One night for this price is OK but nothing more. ",3.0

The wait staff and restaurant manager, Sahid, were all excellent each time we ate at the hotel and very attentive.   The location of the hotel was perfect. It is about a ten minute walk along a new (quieter) street, with access to the east gate of the Taj Mahal.   Roof top area is quite nice and a quiet reprieve from the busyness of AGRA.

"We stayed here for two nights. It is a five minute walk to the East gate of the Taj Mahal.  The hotel wasn’t great. Rooms very dark as they are underground.  We arrived in Agra by train and had arranged for the hotel to collect us. Long story short we had to wait for an hour at Agra station and the driver only came when we called, and then called again. No apology whatsoever once we reached the hotel either.   The reception staff weren’t very attentive either. Several times they broke off what they were doing - checking us in, storing our bags etc, to talk to other people or do other things. It was strange as everywhere else in India the people have been overly attentive.  The drivers we had each day were friendly and informative.  The restaurant on site was good too but again",2.0

Food & Ambience: Be it the roof top restaurant or the enclosed restaurant at the ground floor, the food was an absolute delight. The live music by the local artists add to the charm. The breakfast buffet was sufficient and had variety of options. Food was very tasty throughout of our stay.  Management - very well behaved. a group of gentlemen",5.0
The best thing about the hotel is definitely it's location. It is a 10-15 min walk and the e-rickshaw stand is barely a 5 min walk.

The restaurant on the roof was also a positive and we enjoyed our meals there.  Negatives for this hotel. Do not stay in room 102, 103 or 104. These three rooms are basement rooms and are located directly under the lobby and indoor restuarant. Not only are they dark, dingy (as well as all other rooms on the basement floor) they suffer from constant noise from above. You can hear every person walk across the floor.  At 11pm we were awoken by constant table and chairs moving above. Turns out a late group arrival were put into the restaurant for refreshments prior to being checked in. We complained about",3.0

The shower had a door (great for Indian hotels!). Morning breakfast was alright however the omelette station was the best we've seen in our entire India trip. The chefs there made delicious omelettes.  They have a marble souvenir shop on the lowest level and have puppet shows everyday which are shown by 2 boys. Just be wary that once you go to the puppet show (especially if you are a foreigner) you will probably feel compelled to buy one of their elephants/puppets after the 5 minute show. We didn't mind this too much because the money goes to the boys and their family that makes the puppets. What we didn't like was the marble shop",4.0

I visited Agra on 30th October 2019 with my family and stayed at Taj Resorts for 1 night. The check in was quick and they were kind enough to give us 2 rooms interlinked with each other. We had booked the Premium rooms and found them to be well furnished and clean. The location of the Hotel is excellent. It is on the East Road leading to the East Gate which is the one used for the Public. The Holel is barely 500 meters away from the East Gate. The have an in house restaurant and they serve dinner on the Terrace. The place is lit up and they do have an evening entertainment program of songs sund by their in house singer while dinner is served. I found the food a bit on the expensive side. The morning breakfast was ok. Overall a good place to stay considering the location. Would,4.0
"The Hotel Taj Resort’s location is one of the best in Agra. It’s an easy 10-minute walk to the Taj Mahal’s East gate. Vehicle traffic is restricted in this part of town, so walking around is quite pleasant and includes monkey sightings – but the touts vying for your business can make the walk a bit of a minefield.  The hotel itself is modern, with all the facilities you would expect from a 3-star hotel. Unfortunately, even inside the hotel grounds you will not escape the touts. A typical buffet breakfast is served in the basement – but you must pass through a souvenir store manned by overzealous salespeople to get to your table.   The one outstanding feature of the hotel is the rooftop restaurant, the Taj Terrace. It is not often that a hotel restaurant deserves any special",4.0

"We spent two nights at Hotel Taj Resorts at Agra. It is about a 15 minute walk to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. The room was clean, though a little dated. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was good and the food we had at the rooftop restaurant was excellent. The roof top restaurant does not serve alcohol. We organised a tour of the Taj Mahal through the front desk and enjoyed the services of Mr Ravi Sanjay who was a very good guide. He explained all aspects of the Taj Mahal. ",5.0
The location was very good specially if anybody wants to visit Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal is only 10 minutes walk from the hotel. That is why we managed to visit Taj Mahal just after the gates are open. Rooms are nice and clean. They have one roof top restaurant and a ground floor restaurant as well. They even served us food at 11pm after Taj Mahal night visit. All staffs are courteous. Room tariffs and food prices  I found little bit expensive may be due to the location. Initially after paying the advance for booking I lost communication with the hotel. Finally I got the number of Mr O P Yadav who helped me a lot in terms of booking confirmation and arranging night tickets for Taj Mahal visit. He even personally met me during my stay at hotel. Breakfast quality was good both in terms,4.0

"Hotel location is very good. There are only 2/3 option at this location (about 600 mtr from Taj East gate). This is better from next door (Atulya Taj). Free puppet show, live singing with tabla at rooftop restaurant (Though singers are not of high quality). I guess this is the best option unless you prefer to have ultra luxury facility from Oberoi Group (Amarvilas). Only caveat is food price. Even steam rice is priced over Rs. 250/- (may be this is what has been decided by hotel association coz I found most of the equivalent category restaurant at East Gate charges almost same e.g. butter chicken Rs. 480) Overall nice experience, I enjoyed pool also which is in 3rd floor and having city view. One can view Taj from rooftop",4.0
Very nice hotel for couples. Breakfast is very good. I liked the 5 min puppets show  and the live gazal at candle light dinner. They sell sarees and you would get to see artisans work on show piece in ground floor and sell.  I felt prices are on higher side according to the facilities.,5.0

The Staff is great, very helpful and polite. The rooms are wide and full furnished and also the breakfast was nice, with good choice between sweet and salty. Beside of the hotel, one of the thing you will like most is the dinner: the meals we had at the Taj Terrance were simply wonderful, not only for the tasting food, but also for the kindness and professionalism of the waiting staff in charge (we have been attended by the great Hakim singh, who definitely made our dining experience unforgettable).

"We stayed at Hotel Taj Resorts, Agra for two nights in October, 2019. The hotel is quite adjacent to Taj Mahal; approximate distance of 500 metres from the Eastern Gate. Our room was of Premium category and had all the amenities expected of a hotel of this stature. The staff are very courteous and took care to ensure our pleasant stay at the hotel. The restaurant is bit overpriced but the breakfast (which doesn't cost any extra) was very sumptuous. Overall, a memorable stay.

The street that it is on, leading to the Taj, is well maintained and has police and barriers at the far end to keep things under control. I wasn't sure what kind of hotel I would get, but it turned out to be really nice. A comfortable room (albeit lacking a serious window), good wi-fi, good breakfast and helpful staff at the desk. The let down is the roof top restaurant: not that there is anything wrong with the food, but the Taj is no longer lit up at night, so there is no view.",4.0

We were even treated to a puppet show in the basement, which was good albeit linked to a bit of sales as well. Just go with it or politely say no. Really enjoyed the stay.

Small but a very clean and well maintained pool. - Photo attached   Areas to Improve upon  1. Lighting in the corridors - the blue light was not very ambient / comfortable  2. Staff can be better groomed  3. AC needs some maintenance - wasn't the best. 4. Breakfast can be better,4.0

We stayed at the hotel taj resorts for 4 night's with some friends. It's probably easiest to break this down into pros and cons:  Pros -  1) The location is really close to the Taj Mahal and places to eat. 2) The staff and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful. 3) Nice pool and highly rated in house restaurant (although we didn't go) 4) Free shuttle service from the train station was really helpful.   Cons - 1) The room felt damp pretty much all the time which made the contents of oir suitcases damp. I don't believe the air con is filtering out the humidity that well - there were also damp patches on the walls. 2) Expect to be invited to watch a marblework demo next to the gift shop each morning after breakfast.

Hotel Taj Resorts has a very high level of service. They helped us on getting train tickets for our next destination even though it was a troublesome job. And we were picked up at New Delhi air port when we arrived and driven very safely to the Hotel Taj Resorts. Also the guide they found to us Mr. Sanjay was very professional and service minded. He told us enough interesting facts and stories about the Taj Mahal and Agra Red Fort without overdoing it. And when we were caught in the monsoon rain at Taj Mahal he stayed with us entertaining us until we decided to go through the rain back to the Hotel Taj Resort. He as well as we got soaking wet – and he was all smiles. Thank you to Sanjay and the Hotel Taj Resorts,4.0

Extra bed provided was not up to the expectation it was merely folding bed mounted with plywood top hence not being that comfortable as regular bed could be, since customer is paying for extra bed charges  hotel need to invest more on such things. Corridors need to be more airy and provision for circulation of fresh air must be ensured by Hotel Mgmt. Though breakfast was good but we as vegetarian customers were not comfortable since there was huge smell of Omlette making around complete basement reatraunt.

The room is extremely small and this just makes it that much more pungent with the putrid smell. There is no AC in the room, only a fan. This results in an extremely humid climate where everything you touch is literally sticky. There is not even a real window in the room.   The absolute worst part however is the lack of cleanliness this hotel has. It starts at the bathroom where there is no glass separating the shower. I never have a problem with this, for bathrooms of this style tend to have a slope to drain the water out, but there is nothing here! This makes it wet everywhere you walk. The disgusting toilet and sink",1.0

"We stayed at Hotel Taj Resorts for 1 night as part of a Golden Triangle tour. The location itself couldn't be better, right on the road leading up to the Taj Eastern Gate, on a pedestrian street where traffic isn't allowed (although the Police allow taxis and drivers through for hotel guests).  Unfortunately, the rest of the hotel isn't very nice. The bathroom and bedroom were worn out, and we were in a basement room without any windows.   The breakfast buffet wasn't good quality, and getting to the breakfast room involved passing through a marble carving shop where the staff pester you to browse.   The rooftop restaurant was nice, but unfortunately didn't serve alcohol. This seemed to be the same for most restaurants in the area. There are some beer shops on the street outside",3.0

Last but not the least, this hotel is  located in great  vicinity of the world's best icon of eternal love, i.e. Taj Mahal, we could see it from the top floors of hotel building.  Precisely speaking , guests can take a stroll (walk), at Taj Mahal after having ethnic tasty dinner at hotel restaurant.

"We stayed here from 17-19 February 2019. We booked 2 delux double room. The hotel is very nearby to the Eastern gate of Tajmahal. In the morning anybody can go to taj by walking also.  The stay was great. From room to food, everything was good. The dinner at terrace with music was great. The most excited part is its location. Being a fool moon day, I spent a long time at its terrace and what a lovely view of Tajmahal from there.  Another memorable thing is its souvenir shop at its basement. It was a different experience to see the people preparing the marble table top etc. There was a puppet show every evening at the basement. Kids enjoyed that very much.  Overall a great experience.

"The hotel is located within walking distance of the Taj Mahal, which is convenient for travellers going there at sunrise (which is by the way a good idea to avoid the crowds). We arrived by train, and the hotel messaged us in advanced to offer a complementary pick-up service from the train station. Unfortunately, we had to wait a LONG time for the driver, and for us it would have been far more convenient to pay up for an Uber right away rather than to wait alongside pushy taxi drivers in the heat. The room was of a good standard, as was the pool (we tried it in the evening and the water was far too cold, but that's a sign of changing the water frequently, I suppose). Breakfast was not great – the pancakes were stale (avoid at all costs). The lobby is full of bell boys hoping to",3.0

The pool is just what we needed after a long and hot day. The rooftop restaurant is very recommendable. The manager Op Yadav and the waiter Hakim Singh made my wifes birthday memorable by beatifully decorating the top terasse and serving us a private birthday dinner here overlooking the city and the silhuette of the Taj.

The hotel also has a puppet show in the basement which was something different and fun. The basement marble and clothing shop is worth taking a look around.

Rooms & service were excellent . Being very close to the Taj Mahal was an added advantage . Roof top restaurant experience was very nice with live music . Only suggestion we would give is for the breakfast platter as we felt that variety was very less n also the serving of fruits wasn’t good ( fresh fruit was mixed with leftovers n also cutlery used was just making everything to spill out) . That’s not up to the mark of Taj hotels .,4.0

I have embraced curry for breakfast, the other 2 had toast and there was an egg cooking station. I am not going to lie we couldn’t wait to leave, even though we had a 5 Hr uber ride to Jaipur look forward to.

Check-in was fast and efficient and the room was basic, but could probably do with a deep clean from time to time as it did have a bit of a worn down feel to it. The bathroom was fine, but the shower was AMAZING! Probably the next best thing after the Taj Mahal!  A big thing to point out is that the hotel is a DRY hotel, a point which we didn't realise until we ordered to Kingfisher Ultras and had to settle for a Sprite instead.

In an excellent position within 10 minutes walk of the Taj Mahal eastern gate. since our last visit to Agra 21 years ago, some building has been permitted near the Taj Mahal and this hotel is part of it. One of the best aspects was that only vehicles (other than tuktuks) bringing guests to hotels etc were allowed on the road, and which was clean, attractive, virtually hassle free and a pleasure to walk down, and meant that it was very easy to get to the Taj Mahal itself, the river Yamuna, etc. There is an extensive nature reserve cum park on the way to the Taj Mahal, for a very small payment, and which gives interesting views of the Mahal. There are a variety of restaurants and cafés nearby ranging from the Oberoi",4.0

We had a good time at the sky lounge it was well organised and also had swimming pool.Due to its photogenic orientation a selfie lover wont get tired of clicking pictures... One should visit the rooftop for capturing the Taj Mahal and can also dine at the roof top.. A must watch is the marble emporium at the basement of the hotel...

The only bit I found lacking was the food and response time in certain room services which could have been better. The art gallery is well stocked and we were serviced very politely by Ashwani.

The complimentary breakfast was decent as well. The only bone of content is that the food served is a bit expensive and even though the Indian fare is delicious, the Chinese meals were sub par. But, over all the room and stay were reasonably priced and very comfortable, and I would definitely reccomend the hotel to others.!",4.0
"The front desk staff were very helpful in making travel arrangements and the rooftop deck has nice views of the Taj Mahal (hazy air allowing), which is an easy walk from here. The rooms are comfortable - deluxe rooms have windows, while basic rooms on basement level do not, but seem to have the same layout.  Beds are ok, but a bit hard.  Artwork in hallways and rooms is abstract (I would prefer art relating to Mughal history). Rooftop restaurant had live tabla, pump organ and vocals Indian music - very pleasant with dinners there, which were good.",5.0

Taj Resorts is a good hotel located quite near to the Taj Mahal. It is accessible via the Eastern gate of entry to Taj Mahal.  Rooms are reasonably spacious and the rooftop swimming pool is quite good. Overall a recommended place to stay for a short trip to Agra.,5.0
Hospitality of Taj Resort is excellent. It's lication is also very close to Taj mahal. Experiencing our dinner at open air rooftop restaurant with live music gives us great pleasure.  Food quality is also good.  Subrata Roy Chowdhury  From Kolkata  Stayed at Taj resort on 06/03/19,5.0

"I stayed in hotel taz resort for 4 days . Food,staff,cleanliness was ok . I had only one small issue related with the location of my room. Which I preferred for top floors rooms while booking but I got the room in the basement with out Windows but when I complained I got on the ground floor only. After hotel staff explained me that it was bcz of my type of room ie (executive), which had floor limitation. But this limitation was not indicated in the room details while booking. The good thing which I had from hotel side in my last day dinner they served me complimentary desert. Overall I suggest this hotel for stay.",4.0
"We picked this hotel because it was very Convenient to Taj Mahal. A wonderful walk taking only 15 minutes. Rooms is just ok but  live music on the rooftop each evening creates the ambience. If the night is a bit clearer, you might be able to see the Taj Mahal from the roof top. Food is good and service by the servers is excellent. However, the hotel needs to have new keys created for the rooms. Old ones did not work. Also, very slow with laundry and when delivered, it was still wet. Get it done somewhere else. Some rooms have no windows.",5.0

The pool side Dinner was amazing. Special reference to Saurabh in the restaurant who ensured great service and very efficient. There is a shop in the basement which had great collection of wares and suits.  Breakfast did not have a commendable spread. It was too simple and lacked variety,4.0

"The hotel location was absolutely ideal for the Taj Mahal, just a 10 minute walk away from the East Gate on a road with barely any vehicles. It made getting there for the sunrise super easy.  Getting to the hotel itself was also very easy as the hotel offers a complimentary transfer service.  After visiting the Taj Mahal we really enjoyed the breakfast which was included in the price. The rooftop pool was an ideal place to relax for the rest of the day.  What really set this hotel apart was the service - our train was diverted so it was no longer stopping at Agra and there were no other available trains that day. The General Manager, OP Yadav, went above and beyond to try to help us sort out our travel issues which was much appreciated by two young girls trying to navigate India",5.0
"Our visit to Agra was just for a day, and we had planned to stay as close as possible to Tajmahal to be able to cover it multiple times. Typically, hotels closer to the monuments are not really top notch (besides the high star ones). Having put our bet on Taj resorts, with all positive reviews we read on tripadvisor, it turned out to be an amazing stay. Not only was the hotel closest possible to the wonder, but the kind of facilities, comfort and esp the bliss of seeing Taj from rooftop it provided, turned out to be an unexpectedly pleasurable experience. The plush rooms, you name it and find it kind of breakfast assortment and on top of all courteous staff provide you the kind of environment you look for. In Mr. OP Yadav, they have a very professional and eager to look after",5.0
We have stayed in this hotel to visit The Taj Mahal. This hotel is very near to the Taj Mahal. They are having very well standard rooms and employees. The stay was very comfortable and the staffs are very polite and friendly. They have a roof top restaurant and a swimming pool. They are organizing free puppet show which is in my opinion is their center of attraction. Overall we had a wonderful stay in this hotel.,5.0

"We spent 3 nights here, the hotel was literally a five minute walk from Taj Mahal and is situated on a restricted traffic road / access only road which is also policed. We were handed a complementary drink on arrival, check in was a smooth process and the staff were all genuinely lovely and helpful. Breakfast was good, a wide choice which varied each day. I had an issue with a booking  elsewhere and the hotel staff used their own bank card to assist as international cards wouldn't be accepted and the staff member even accepted a mixture of currency in return. This was a huge help as I couldn't continue my travels without. Rooms are very clean, linen and towels changed daily and complementary water restocked daily.  Rooms had a fridge and mini bar if required. Hot water was",5.0
"HOTEL TAJ RESORT - AGRA.  I happily stayed at Hotel Taj Resort at Agra on 26th February '19, and would recommend to my friends. However, it must  be noted that this is not the part of leading chain 5 stars Taj Group of hotels ( Indian hotels Limited)   Location: location of this Hotel is really beautiful, just walking distance from East Gate of Taj which is also known as VIP Gate, as all VIP's and Dignitaries enter from this gate. The benefit of East Gate is that  it is very less crowded and in case one has not booked ticket online, it can be easily bought from booking window without much waiting, which would take long time at West Gate which is always crowded.

Small but clean rooms. Clean bathroom. Really great Souviner shop and a roof top view of the Taj. 4 to 5 min walking distance from Taj East gate entrance. Opp. a gate of the Oberoi Amarvilas.

"We had such an amazing, relaxing time here. We were coming from the chaotic city of Delhi and needed some peace of mind. The hotel is located very close to the Taj mahal, I think we walked there in about 10 minutes. They have a roof terrace (Highest of all buildings around) that has an excellent view of the Taj Mahal. In the morning it was often a bit foggy but after 11:00 it usually clears and the view is amazing. Just sit there with a cup of tea and enjoy. The staff is nice and professional and will do anything to help you out. We had to catch a train to Jaipur early in the morning and the guy at the reception desk heard us talk about it. He then warned us that the trains were cancelled due to heavy fog. Had it not be for him we wouldn't have known and we would've been",5.0

The room was small and pokey with no window.  I asked to be allocated another room as I had booked a superior suite , which stated feather pillows, bath robe and slippers. We were then given an identical room to the first but with a window! We were so tired we decided it would do, the view from the window was horrid, no bathrobe, no slippers and definitely no feather pillow. I checked the pillow to see and took a picture of the filth,(see pic), We went up to the restaurant to eat , again looked up and down, the food was nice but the waiter so condescending he even reminded us to give a good review.",2.0

Would defo stay again and I was sad to leave. I came by train and was promised a free station pick up. However due to a silly typo I gave the hotel the wrong arrival time which gave them no time available to get me. As a good will gesture they gave me a free taxi drop of when I left.

Family of four with kids aged 9 and 11. The hotel is very convenient for the Taj and overall experience was very good 3 star. Staff very attentive and we had dinner in the rooftop. Local cuisine is very good. If your children want more European cuisine it’s ok also but just not as good as proper Indian! No alcohol a surprise!  ,4.0
"The hotel is conveniently located at walkable distance from the Taj Mahal's East gate and it is reasonably priced. The room was comfortable and clean.  The hospitality and warmth of all the hotel staff is commendable. Mr. Yadav, the general manager, was prompt in addressing my requirments for a cab and a guide at suitable prices. He ensured the services were well organized and I felt secure.  Watching the artisans at work at the souvenier store at the lower level of the hotel, dinner at the roof top restaurant with live Indian musicians and folk dancers at the reception in the evenings added to the whole experience.  I am so glad I choose to stay to the hotel. My trip was made more memorable and hassle free. I recommend this place for all types of tourists.",5.0

Sunil on the roof terrace was particularly attentive on our meal here. The roof terrace was a welcomed break after a day sightseeing with a nice pool and lovely views across to the Taj.  Be aware of the free puppet show in basement of hotel which we found a ploy to buy things from shop you walkthrough to get to show.

We stayed in the Taj Resort Hotel and enjoyed the hospitality of the Hotel Staff.  All very helpful and friendly people.
