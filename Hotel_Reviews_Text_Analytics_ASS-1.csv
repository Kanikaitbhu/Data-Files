"We organised our engagement ceremony here in October'20 after a thorough survey of all 5 stars in Gurgaon and Hyatt was by far the best choice. Vikas, the executive who dealt with us was extremely helpful and helped us organise a perfect event even in such stressful times. The food was one of the best we've had at a 5 star and the service was exceptional. Right from food tasting, decoration, to room bookings, we were very well supported at every step. The ballroom is an exceptional venue for the event. In fact we like the venue and service so much that we approached Vikas for the wedding reception too which we will be hosting there in Jan. I think Hyatt sits at the perfect intersection of good food, beautiful venue, great staff and service and perfect pricing.",5

"Pathetic, careless and unsafe are three words that are understatement to explain the attitude and behavior of the hotel and their staff in this world which is still trying to come out of the impact of the pandemic. The dreaded viral infection of corona is still pretty much rampant and no city, no nation has been able to recover from this but it seems this hotel on the outskirts of Gurgaon has found ‚Äòsome sort of cure and means to immunize their staff and guests‚Äô Let me be very straight and upfront for ease of everyone‚Äôs understanding. We were  a group of 2 couples with children, decided to check into this hotel for the weekend thinking that Hyatt as a brand would be taking all necessary precautions and following the COVID-19 safety protocols as mandated by MHA but to our utter",1
"We stayed in the Regency suite on the 15th floor and it was absolutely amazing! This large and luxurious suite comes with a living room, bedroom and a humongous bathroom with a walk in closet. The swanky bathroom comes with a lovely jacuzzi bathtub. The multicusine restaurant left us spoilt with choice and the food was great. We also loved the hospitality and great service. Overall, we had a lovely stay here. ",5
"Stayed at a Regency Suite Room under the Staycation package. Spacious and nice suite, worth it. However, the main bathroom basin was cracked. Food was great. Staff was exceptionally helpful. Kitchen District restaurant was the only one open - food quality and taste was great, but what was very disappointing was that the plates, cutlery and crockery consistently looked unclean, as though not properly washed, which is not expected. In terms of Covid-related safety measures, other than this last aspect mentioned, the hotel seemed to implement measures adequately.",4
"Mr. Ajay, Mr. Amit did the best to serve our family on my birthday during such a difficult pandemic times. I wish them best for them and for the Hyatt who has such a capable team. Thanks to Mayank for taking my reservation and communicating my actual requirements to the team. Thanks to chef for all delicacies.  Thanks Amit and Ajay. Cheers.",5

Special mention to the restaurant manager Rishabh for suggesting us various types of meals. He also ensured that he followed up if it was as per our liking. I absolutely loved that he was considerate that we were staying with a small baby, so he kept asking us if we need something for the baby. Such team members are an asset to the company.  Recommended for stay for everyone. And we will visit again soon for sure.",5
"We had a stay for 3 days at hyatt regency with family, relatives and friends for my sister's wedding. All of us had an amazing time there. From the start entire staff was very helpful but one person 'Aurka' stands out who was there for us from start till end. He is a dedicated employee of hyatt who made sure we had a pleasant stay and experience best time of our life. There may have been couple of hiccups which are quite normal when it comes to managinf wedding functions but Aurka dealt with our issues and resolved them in a timely manner.

"We have been visiting Hyatt Manesar for many years and each time the service and stay has been excellent. Though on our last visit in November this year things were not as great as our expectations and maybe the changing times and staff could have been a reason for the same. Quality of food especially ""Pizza and Pasta"" was not upto the mark. Just sharing an honest feedback so that things can improve and get back to old standards :) Would also like to put a good word for Harbhajan in Dinning, he is a treat to talk and a person with exceptional service and humility.  Our feedback is just for improvement and not in terms of any disappointing bad experience.  Always been a Happy Customer with Hyatt. Cheers!",4

"I was travelling from jaipur to delhi and on my way back, I booked Hyatt regency manesar on a friends suggestion. To my surprise it was far better than I had heard. I was reluctant to go to the restaurant for the breakfast but then manager Harbhajn assured me off all the covid protocols being followed ensuring a safe environment was there to dine in.

"After COVID19 came to our planet, everything changed for good and for worse.   Me and my partner wanted to get away from the mundane chores of life. A break was required!   So, my partner suggested Hyatt Regency and without any second thoughts he booked it. When it was time to check in, the reception staff was very kind. They upgraded the room to a suite at a nominal price. Breakfast and lunch was included.  The included meals were heavenly. Even amidst coronavirus, the food selection was quite elaborate. Presentation and quantity were spot on.   The suite room has a massive jacuzzi. It is the perfect room for a couple. All Covid 19 safety measures were taken care of.   A lil tip: biryani can be improved. Rest everything was brilliant. Veg salt n pepper, chilly chicken, dosa,",5

"The location of this hotel is neither fish nor meat. Somewhere out in nowhere. Meals are fine but service is poor in dining room and worse at reception. Phone to guest services is not answered after midnight. Rooms lack maintenance, electricity problems, safe inoperative and clothes hangers like in a cheap hotel ( anti-theft) minibar is empty and can apparently be dilled upon request. Are we talking Hyatt???",4

"As a company"" Travel A Deal "" , we have done many events and one such event was memorable and executed on ground flawlessly by the team at Hyatt Regency Gurgoan. The overall experience of contracting the business months in advance to the actual event was a great journey. Mr. Vipin Singh & Ashish Ray were instrumental in closing the business. Mr. Vipin Singh was always available for any concerns and addressed most of our requirements to the best interest of the clients & the hotel management. Mr. Rahul Sharma who was later in the process responsible for the reservations and the event requirement along with flow of event, extended immense co-operation and showed great dedication towards the work in hand. The Banquet team of Hyatt Regency, Gurgoan along with Chef are just amazing,",5
Excellent stay at the hotel. The buffet dinner and breakfast was lavish and well presented.special attention was given by akash and sudhanshu at Kitchen district. Highly recommended. Loved the stay!!!,5
"After paying a ‚Äûspecial rate‚Äú of about 470 ‚Ç¨ (for 3 nights) without Breakfast I expected a hotel in much better condition. A broken blind to the bathroom, a marble service door at the bathtub fixed with tape, not the cleanest blanket and a more or less worn out carpet, just to name my problems. Friends talked about a broken shower.  Although the staff was really very friendly and helpful, both at check-in and during the entire stay.  But anyway - I wouldn‚Äôt complain if the rate was about 90-100 ‚Ç¨ but not 156 ‚Ç¨.",3
Lovely buffet & very helpful staff. Ajay Bhist was extremely attentive & helpful. It is a beautiful property & close to gurgaon city. Also very close to the airport. The hotel was clean & sparkly. Thanks.,5

One thing which you shouldn't miss in this Hotel is the Breakfast spread prepared by Chef Ajit. It has good continental menu and Indian Menu.

Yet I‚Äôd stay here again without giving it a second thought because of the staff.  They deliver impeccable service! I really can‚Äôt say enough about them. Their elegant manners, hard work, and friendliness surpass any hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed. They go above and beyond what is required. The South Indian chef at the Kitchen cooked the most heavenly spicy dishes, the rooms are clean and the housekeeping staff are kind, polite and readily available if you need anything. The In room dining staff delivered food quickly and efficiently, plus it‚Äôs great!  There are so many amazing staff that deliver the best services to make for a comfortable stay.

Some of the really nice things about the hotel are: First, the rooms are really clean, good and modern Second, the staff is really good- I wanted to use the gym (their gym is really good) and the personal trainer (Azaad) wasvreally nice and helpful. Azaad really went out of his way to ensure I had a good workout. Third, the food including the breakfast is really good This is a really nice hotel. Anupam",5

"I stayed at the Hyatt from the 27-31 st of January 2020. My experience at the hotel was horrible . I am a hyatt member but still no perks . I was there with my son who was playing a big golf tournament near by . One morning we left the hotel at 7 am and returned at 5pm and still my room was not cleaned . All that the staff did was argue and make excuses . The food at the coffee shop was disgusting . Buffet was not edible . When we called the chef , he too only argued. They had no regrets about anything. One of the days I was sitting in the bar during tea time and we called for coffee and the sandwich and dessert trays . They served home made actually worse than home made sandwiches in white bread with cucumber and tomatoes so badly cut . I called the chef and showed him if this",1
amazing hospitality and provide me room according to my preference also one thing which i notice that hotel had very broad corridor and spacious rooms location is bit outside but still lovely i would like to thanks Ankit for cake and arrangements.,5
I stayed in this hotel for my bussiness. The hotel is very dirty. ƒ∞n your room they are putting used complimentary items. Bed linens are dirty. At restaurant plates are always dirty and when you order something it comes very late and wrong. They are not able to do this correctly. ,1

Good Areona ... Service was good  Staff named Parveen was highly supportive and enthusiatic.Hotel with such high value should prefer guy like Parveen . Good sleep quality.. But sudden cut of electricity seems bad..,4
The rooms are excellent. I choose this property for doing the brain storming about my business from a peaceful place . Location suits me very well because its away from the traffic of Delhi. Staff in general is very good. The food is a bit spicy for me. The club Regency can offer better snacks etc during non happy hours. ,4

Not only our diet restrictions were well taken care of, it exceeded our expectations. Everything has been fantastic so far.

I would love to come at this hotel",5
"Hotel is well located for any business trip near Gurugram. Room is well maintained. Reception staff is also great. Coming to food, there is selection from continental to indian. Breakfast also gives good choices.   A specific mention is for our Mallu community. South Indian Chef Mr Ajit Kumar is excellent and he just identify a Malayalee with grace and rest assured, you feel you are in Kerala (only thing missing is the backwaters!,). Fantastic Kerala delicacies you can relish. A must place for malayalees to visit and enjoy the morning breakfast buffet.

My most recent stay was a good example of that. I was very sick during my last stay (which had nothing to do with the hotel but was something that I believe I picked up traveling).   The staff checked on me frequently, provided extra blankets, catered to my special requests for foods that could eat and facilitate getting medical attention.   I cannot tell you how much it was appreciated.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5
"Since I have a long stay at the Hyatt, the chefs ensure that you feel at home ..Specially chef Ajith who goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable by preparing home style cuisines ..Kind of home away from home .. üëè",5

"We have had quite a long acquaintance with the Hyatt Regency in Gurgaon. But our previous visit wasn't very satisfying. We spoke to the concerned team and Mr.Rajawat, who heads the room's division, tended to our problem very patiently. The suite room was brilliant, along with the relaxing jacuzzi. Will surely visit the Hyatt again. Thank you team. Job well done.",5

"Hyatt Regency Gurgaon is not just a hotel but a peaceful haven for the people who don't want to spend hours in travelling to enjoy a fun vacation on a weekend /holiday.   Just a perfect location , very much in the city and still peaceful and calm. Hyatt Regency Gurgaon is the place to be when you are with friends or family. Beautiful and spacious rooms. This time we opted for a family Suite on the Top floor. Beautiful aerial views of the city and the room was such a delight. A nice living room with its separate washroom and a huge bedroom with a separate fully loaded bathroom and wardrobe area. Jacuzzi was a pleasure to have for our daughter as it was cold and she couldn't use the swimming pool. Also the specially designed Children's activity area next to the pool has small",5

I recently had an opportunity to stay at Hyatt Gurgaon Manesar. The hotel is a top notch. The staff is well trained professional and very experienced. Must say they understand the nuance of hospitality industry to the core. One such individual was Mr Ajith Kumar. Not only was he skilled in his work but also he had a very warm and welcoming personality. Hyatt will definitely be my choice of hotels and one of the reason is the quality of staff they employ. The quality of food is at par or far better than most of the competition. For example the breakfast. It‚Äôs hard to get the bacon done right but you guys managed it. The breakfast also had great combinations of South Indian delicacies very intricately prepared by Ajith and team. Once again thank you for the wonderful hospitality. ,5

"For us Hyatt has been a top of the end brand and every Hyatt hotel we have stayed has resonated with ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. While the Hyatt sector 83 Gurgaon resonates of the same brand but there are so many examples where you feel as if it is an average hotel.   Room - spacious rooms with all amenities and lot of natural light. This would be the highlight of the hotel.   Staff - courteous staff.   Despite all the good stuff, we noticed multiple neglected areas which were  not in line with the Hyatt Brand we have experienced. Maybe this property is doing really bad and they have had to resort to drastic measures to cut costs or maybe it‚Äôs just stupidity.   Some examples :     - the furniture in the main lobby is both un-inspiring, extremely uncomfortable and low quality. The chairs shake",4

"The reason why I gave this property a 3 star is because of its location and the service quality. Hotel is located far away from gurgaon city center and Delhi. Going to any place is time consuming and expensive unless you have your own car. Other than if you are planning to play a lot of golf at the Classic country club or Tarudhan valley golf course. There‚Äôs hardly anything close by or at a walking distance ( read restaurants, malls etc.) Secondly their whole team is very tardy with respect to service. We had to call at least thrice before we could get any kind of service , be it in room dining or replenishing tea bags and water bottles. It took them for ever. On one instance they left half of the room unclean not bothering to  vacuum the carpets and dust the tables. Though the",3

"The Hyatt Gurgaon is a beautiful property, I had checked-in for a night. However, even within that limited period, I could have a very satisfying and Royal experience. I guess it is all due to wonderful staff at Hyatt Gurgaon. Vishal (front office) was very helpful and kind during the check-in. A great first impression for the hotel.

Venue that they offered to us in was good addition to it provided us the good facility of PA system. All together it was an good experience thanks to Manager and Chef",4
"I stayed in Hyatt few days back. (had stayed earlier also); This time services were not up to the mark, no trained staff, room was not cleaned properly. I was sitting in coffee shop, a guy came and introduced himself as Manager (i think, his name was Mr. Shriram), when i discussed these things, he directly started bowing down for apologies...(means which type of hospitality it is), with no communication and strong body odour. Experience was totally ruined...will look better option in next visit.",1
Restaurant is awesome. I don't prefer travelling and there are other hotels nearby my work place but I prefer this hotel to taste breakfast from Chef Mr. Ajith.

"This was one of my most memorable hotel stays in a long time. From check-in to check-out, everything was literally perfect. I arrived a bit earlier than planned, and they had a room for me ready on the city side (I heard from others that pool side gets a little noisy sometimes because of celebrations). The restaurant buffet breakfast, lunch & dinner provides choices for all sorts of dietary concerns. being Vegan, I can only suggest that they also put signage for Vegan and not just Vegetarian or non-Veg. In any case, it was very easy to discuss with the chefs and get what I wanted. I have to admit that I love Indian food. I also had a massage at the spa and it was great. This hotel is very clean and everyone is extremely friendly and forthcoming. I look forward to my next stay in",5

Smaller details like multiple specs plugs, electric operated shower blinds, easy operating hot and shower and seperate tub are some feature. Abundant closet space and a permanent iron box and board and provided. I prefer pool view but road view is nice as well. Food is good and portions are large.

"Visited this hotel this month with family due to an emergency situation. Picked this terrible place over Oberoi Gurgaon because my mother had been previously and she said she wanted to come back. Our experience as a whole has been terrible. Terrible front desk attitude by the Lobby Manager Pintu . The rooms given to us #1120&1132 had torn linen and dirty linen. A hotel like this is having torn linen is absolutely terrible. The food is mediocre not very good . The IRD when it came should have given us Napkins and salt , these are basic amenities with food i believe. The lackluster attitude of the front office is lackluster. The bathroom in #1120 was leaking . Rooms should be checked before handing over to guest. To top it all despite us idenfying 4 pieces of luggage only two",1
"As a Hyatt globalist member,  I got free upgrade to a suite, complimentary breakfast,  free lounge access to the club and quick service.  My only concern is that it is right after crossing the toll which will cost you if you are going by the car (2 wheelers are for free) for every transistor (Rs. 65). If hotel can have some tie up to avoid such tolls then it will be a good deal",4
"In Hyatt Regency Gurgaon.  Lobby floor, there is a massage place.   Great staffs and services! I‚Äôve visited the place twice!!  You‚Äôve got to get the body scrub with oil-soaked salts. So satisfied! 90 minuets of pure relaxing. ",5

"We had a short yet a wonderful experience, the front desk staff was amazing and so was the kitchen district! This was our third stay at this hotel, Whenever we have a extended weekend holiday and wish to go out, Hyatt ( Gurgaon) has always been the unanimous choice. We have tried most of the hotels in NCR, but no one can come close to their hospitality.",5
One of the best hotel that we have stayed at. This was our third stay at this hotel.We stayed in a suite which was spotlessly clean and  comfortable. Beyond the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel the next best part was the food. The service was exceptional and the facilities were pretty good. The staff was friendly and professional. ,5
"Stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and found it to be one of the better hotels that we visited. Great reception team at the front desk with no communication problem. Access to the elevator & rooms are controlled with key card. The room is spacious and clean with toiletries, towels and complimentary water refilled everyday. Water pressure is great and controls works well. Refrigerator is filled with the necessary refreshments. Problem is the CTV... does not work well & cable network connection hopeless. During my 7 day stay we experienced blackout 4 times but connection was made within 5 minutes. Despite this setbacks the breakfast served was awesome with authentic Indian cuisine and Western dishes, great coffee & fruit juices....  Concierge staff was helpful and quick to",4

Thanks to all for making this a most memorable visit, we hope to return.",5

Thanks for all your services, shall c u soon...",5
"Location of the Hotel is just after the Toll plaza on the HIghway when you exit Gurgaon towards Manesar. So nothing near by in a walking distance but was ideal for me for a peaceful relaxing weekend stay. Check in was smooth and friendly.  Stayed in a King King Room which was quite big in size compared to some other 5 Star Hotel rooms. Very comfortable and modern.  Only drawback I had was that the food was below average in taste and quality. Had buffet as it was included in my Room price. Service was friendly but ultra slow for freshly made Pizza and Pasta we ordered from the buffet. Probably because it was  crowded at that time. During breakfast was also crowded but food was good and the service ok. Overall , a good Hotel to stay.",4
Place is really nice. Staff was great. I really enjoyed my stay here Ajay on the staff was extremely helpful in the restaurant. The rooms were very clean and the service was second to none. I will be staying here next time I visit India,5
"I‚Äôm a hyatt Globalist, and have stayed at various hyatt properties worldwide. My first time stay at the hyatt regency gurgaon was made special by chef Ajith kumar. He went out of his way to make me feel at home, esp during Onam :-), whipped up some delectable Onam fare. He also coordinated With their rooms division to ensure I didn‚Äôt have to change hotels due to high occupancy. Vikram Rajawat - the rooms division head ensured that I focus on my business rather than shifting hotels in the middle of the week!. Truly felt special, thank you Ajit kumar & Vikram Rajawat for your special hospitality. ",5
"I stayed in Hyatt Regency for 3 days whilst on a business tour. I found the overall experience with them more than satisfying. In fact, I was delighted to be there. I found it great value for money. They have an excellent Gym, good tasty food at their restaurants, very courteous staff, and above all would rate very high on hygiene levels. I was overawed when I was told that they can handle guests to the tune of 1800 at a time in their banquets. That‚Äôs quite phenomenal. I would recommend this hotel to any future corporate programs we would host.",5
"The booking information and updates are commandable.Hyatt is comfortable to me due to Proximity to my Project location, Its warm n caring staff but also the overall Environment n cleanliness. Would continue to stay here further",5

"I stayed there for one week, the first thing that you notice is how the staff is nice. very helpful. special shout to Vikash Singh for the Regency Lounge !!! it was a pleasure meeting him after a long day of work and just chill out with a glass of chardonnay. Hyatt Gurgon is really a business hotel, but you ll not feel it. the staff makes you very comfortable. It was my first time in India, and I felt just like home. Thanks to the restaurant team (on the 1st floor) and also Aman SIngh, you'll die for his canap√©s!!! again thx and good job !!! hope to see you soon !",5
"The hotel was okay.  I guess it was okay for the area.  The furnishings are dated and well worn.  Restaurant staff was very nice, but food was mediocre.  I‚Äôm not convinced the restaurant has great hygiene.  Somewhat what I expect for the area.",3
"We were at Hyatt Regency to attend a Global Dealer Meeting for 2 days and booked our stay for 2 additional nights to avoid changing hotels. The experience at Hyatt Regency, unfortunately, was very disappointing for us. The first day the bathroom drainage was stuck and water flowed all over and we reported it. They claimed to have rectified but in the evening the problem was still there with the entire bathroom overflowing. Eventually it was cleared but not the sort of experience one expects at a 5* facility. Power outages were very frequent and most TV channels never working - claiming not subscribed - why have them in the first place.On the positive side the breakfast was very good layout and enjoyable. Another downside came on our accommodation rates for 2 additional nights.",3
"Best in Class Service Loved the hospitality and service. The Suite is so beautiful, had an amazing experience, Best in quality and cleanliness. The staff was very cordial and courteous. Well spoken people and very good quality of food. Breakfast spread is amazing",5

"Nice hotel with lavish rooms. Unfortunately, that is where the splendor ends. The staff in the coffee shop / restaurant seem to be making half-hearted effort in their service. They never seem to be listening to what I wanted, and almost always got the food wrong. I wanted a tea for breakfast and asked for a tea bag and was told they don't have tea bags, only steeped tea.  Being a ""World of Hyatt"" member, they would place a flag on my table so I would get excellent service, but it never happened. One day there was no hot water in the room. I called concierge and was told to call 1188. Duh, they could have said, ""Let me connect you to the department who will be able to help you with this"". The attendant in the fitness center had a tough time getting the steam to work in the steam",3
"Hyatt Gurgaon, Manesar is the beautiful property for any occasion. Rooms are spacious and clean, food is delicious, environment is beautiful, staff is caring and supportive so it is all worth spending here.",5
"It was family trip to run away from domesticity and boy did the wonderful staff of hyatt help us do just that!   From the check in till the time we checked out, we were pampered and made to feel oh-so-special. Special thanks to Mr Pintu the manager and a gentleman! His warm personal touch made the trip even more memorable. The food I must say was quite exceptional! Am still thinking of the appams even as I type this! And the restaurant wonderfully managed by mr faujan.  The only bad part of the trip is that once we returned home, we are finding it hard to adjust back to our regular bed, our regular food and our regular erratic maid service!!!  üòÖ So looking forward to our next trip to Hyatt!  Just want to say thank you to the entire staff for making me earn a lot of points from",5
Hyatt Regency Gurgaon is a good hotel located outside the Gurgaon near the toll plaza. We went to celebrate the friends birthday.

"Hyatt regency gurgaon is a decent hotel. Bit far from Delhi. Rooms are huge and tastefully decored. Bath room is big, clean and spacious. View was fabulous overlooking the aravalli hills. Breakfast and dinner buffet had a good spread. The maintenance of swimming pool is shabby. It was stagnant and breeding ground for live insects and mosquitoes to my surprise. Despite showing it to duty manager, the same could not be rectified in the duration of my stay.",3

Whether it was the staff at the Reception or In-Room dining or House-keeping or the Stewards/Stewardesses.

The Washrooms are simply superb and give you a feeling of the real 5-Star cleanliness & hygiene. Strongly recommended for all kind of visitors, Solo, Family or Business. You would want to keep coming back for more. Do have a taste of the very awesome ""Masala Tea"" at the Hyatt Regency",5

The comfort and the level of service I received at Hyatt was outstanding and was treated as a premium guest even though not being the member. Vikas in RC and Pinto at Reception has been very kind and friendly.. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who want to relax from the rush of the City... Only demerit is that you won't get many food options outside but you can ofcourse order using swiggy or Zomato for delivery. Have a good stay. Enjoy the world of Hyatt.",5

"I stayed at this property in December last year and was suitably impressed. This prompted another trip in August. We booked the club room and we were thoroughly disappointed. 1. We were asked to take our bfast at the restaurant instead of club lounge which kinda beats the purpose of choosing a clubroom. 2. The staff at the lounge were untrained about the menu specs and extras we could order. 3. The finger food was spicey on two consecutive days. Cauliflower 65 was red and spicy and simply not 5 star standards. The chicken manchurian could be compared to a road side dhabha. Cheese were served without crackers and inspite of repeatedly reminding,were never given. These are basics and it was sad to see the shoddy job of cocktail hours (which had only mojito as a singular cocktail).",3

We live in Delhi and was looking for getaway place for weekend with our 2year old, minus the long drive, then after searching a bit found Hyatt regency Gurgaon NH8, which has every thing we needed, a pool, good comfortable, spacious room, brunch with alcohol option.  Check in was perfect,but post check in we did felt little out of place as we barely saw anyone for assistance, but as there was 2 events and a marriage function going on, we gave that a pass. Also post check in they were very helpful in relocating our room as we requested for highway view room.  Coming to room, spacious, clean and well equipped with entertainment system, the most important part which we look apart from room",5

All my friends loved it. The staff was so helpful at every point and made the check in check out process soo easy and fast. Room service was very fast and the food was very tasty. I would love to visit them again soon.,5
"We checked in for a  3 night family leisure trip.It was a wonderful experience.Its a very huge widespread property with a beautiful view from the room.The room is very spacious with all ameneties well maintained.  Right from the begining Diksha the duty manager saw to it that the check in was very smooth and comfortable.  Their breakfast had a variety of cuisine and we were thoroughly taken care of by their very courteous staff.The chef Ajith made specially customised south Indian delicacies for us. Ajay N, Sujita,Abhishekh and Lalit specially including many more whose names we are missing out took care of us in the 'Kitchen district' restaurant.  The club lounge facilities given to us pampered us with lovely snacks and beverages and made our evenings special.  Every request was",5

"The rooms are big and beautiful, with an even bigger bathroom. Housekeeping is awesome with everything spick and span. Nice gardens and wonderful pools for adults and kids. And an awesome restaurant and lounges to satisfy the food cravings. They also serve some authentic leaf teas, which is a must try. Also Chef Ashutosh's Kitchen District serves up some authentic indian, chinese and continental fare with all three live kitchens operating inside the restaurant. Stayed for a couple of days and made the best of everything. The location is close to Manesar, but in this part of Gurugram, on the highway, there is nothing better than this place. Worth spending a weekend as well.",5
"Stay was really comfortable, location of the hotel and connectivity is good too, staff was cooperative and suugestions for dishes by Abhishek and Ajay during breakfast is what I loved. You can also relax in the pool which is well maintained",5
"We stayed here for a long weekend, mainly to utilize our Hyatt membership points.  The hotel is located far from the city & airport, almost near Manesar. But that was ok for us, as we didn‚Äôt have to venture into the city during our stay. The check in and check out are seemless, we requested for a highway view room, as that side is more lively with the Aravalis lining the horizon.  Club access is good, although the veg food options need serious upgrades. Plus, the snacks seem to vanish quicker than the pantry could dish them out. So there was a long wait at times.  The breakfast layout is quite nice, with adequate variety for vegetarians. The staff was on top of their game even though the place was full.  Dinner scene is a bit morose however, esp if you go for a la cart and not",4

"The best thing about a hotel is not only its property but more of its people. Hyatt had very wonderful front office team, trying to customize the best of experience for you. Very helpful concierge, doorman, lobby people, every one amazing you and giving you very personal attention. However the experience with its back office was not upto the standards of Hyatt. Calls and supplies taking time. Another crown jewel was the Kitchen District where we had best of the south indian and north indian breakfast. Along with the super duper staff who was forthcoming to throw them challenges of our fancies. ",4

"*The ideal blend of flavors and ethnicity, the grand Rajasthani Thali Festival at Hyatt was nothing less than a culinary delight . Chef Poonam delighted us with spectacular dishes that clearly boasts of the traditional flavors of Rajasthani cuisines. Each and every item served had a specialty to it which not only was a delectable experience but appetising and healthy as well. Some of the exquisite dishes worth trying were the authentic Dal Bati Churma, Gatte Ke Sabzi, Urad Dal Kachori, Badam Ka Halwa and Kalakund. The festival at Hyatt was a marvelous event to watch with a fascinating decoration at the entry and hospitable services that are worth mentioning.

I stayed for two nights during May 2019 . The property is certainly not shy of anything whereby it can be graded as a good quality 5 star property in every way. Housekeeping is doing good job of keeping the rooms and the common areas yet looking new. The concept of a sofa in the room is much better as it seats two and much more comfortable. The beds are large and offer excellent quality of sleep. The Kitchen restaurant serves a good breakfast. I highly recommend the Roast Duck which is always on the menu and can be ordered at anytime. The service is very good. The reception is very helpful and Mr. Francis will be happy to jot down your preferences for all further visits as they would be entered into the Hyatt system. This helps even when travelling to other locations where a,4

Mr. Pintu Hasamsha at Front Office was excellent to take care of some challenges I had due to the elections and it was only because of his help that I could take very good care of my overseas clients.   Highlight of my Stay has been the amazing breakfast served by Mr. Ajith Kumar, South Indian Chef.

"Booked a fun pack room for personal vacation. Bathroon condition was pathetic due to which i guess our trip has been ruined.Taps were not working properly,hand showers were broken, hand faucet were not working, no washers beneath taps in wash basin. No toiletries. Even weighing machine was not working. No sports channels in tata sky pack. I mean these are basic things which should be there in 5 star properties. I paid Rs 8000 for that room which i feel has been waisted & our trip has been ruined due to these flaws in the room. Although front desk staff was quite good, but there were no sauna bath avlbl at Spa, steam bath was there but not working. My money has been waisted & i strongly demand either full refund or a night stay free of cost from Hyatt Team. Lalit Manak",2

"Second stay at this lovely Hotel which is approx 35 mins from Delhi International airport.  Check in was smooth and the service received throughout our stay was very good. We stayed as a party of four adults & two children in 2 Club rooms one being a Regency Suite.  The Suite was very impressive and was only booked because we previously stayed in the same suite.  Club access was a bonus, with hot drinks and a two hour ""free alcoholic drinks"" and snacks in the evening promo.  We had booked Dinner & Breakfast too so it was a fairly busy schedule before checkout in the morning.  I have rated the whole experience 4* as it was definitely not up to the superb standard when we stayed at the same hotel in 2016 (see earlier review) was left somewhat disappointed as that stay exceeded in",4

That being said, if you need somewhere well priced and comfortable located between Delhi & Jaipur, this is absolutely ideal. Really good breakfast, large rooms, a pool and sound service.

Sachin and others   they all take really good care of me as if I am their elder brother.

Check in was at room when we asked for club lounge check in. When we arrive at hotel we always want to have a seat and a drink served at club lounge. Hotel volunteered to settle with driver the supposed toll fee of 120 inr with receipt shown which driver had readied. Toll is supposed to be included prepaid taxi fare just like when we took uber to airport next day (no toll fee). The hotel staff ‚Äúsettled‚Äù but told us it is 230 rupees which was double what driver told us and no receipts shown to us. Its not the amount but the situation which marred the stay. Other than that Service and F&B was excellent. ,3
Hotel is always extraordinary by its staff !! One of the Hyatt team member Rohit always makes our visit worthwhile by his curtious and friendly behaviour!!  One of the main reason to visit hyat is now Rohit for us !!  I request the Hyatt team to please acknowledge his efforts and service !!  Regards Divya ,5

All the staff of the hotel in various departments - events, banquets, chefs, front office and others - were ever cooperative and always at hand to help and provide their valuable support.

I slept well knowing that my baby has eaten to her heart's content. Thank you chef and Hyatt team for making it so pleasant and relieving.

"We booked to avoid unpleasant surprises after a long trip to Nepal. Typical India replication of a western hotel. Decent room and amenities, but pricey for the location. As the crow flies only a few mile from the airport but distance means nothing in India. An hour or two from the airport depending on traffic and this hotel is a long drive from old Delhi. Don't let the map fool you. No airport shuttle is available so you will be on your own to and from the airport. Better choices in better locations are available unless you have business in Gurgaon proper.",4
"I would love to mention a great host , a certain Mr ishaank Louhchab , who had helped me making the stay of one of my dear ones a memorable one. The gentleman  was extremely curtious , helpful and went out of his way to make the stay a happy experience. In the age of Instagram where the wow factor has become an average , the gentleman is rightly earning the right of public appreciation and truly represents the Hyatt family a recommendable one. Thank you Ishaank and thank you Hyatt. I highly recommend this property.",5

Then I was impressed by Sandeep Rawat in House Keeping who was courteous  and apart from doing his duties, did enquire about my welfare and offered assistance in case I needed.

Sarijita and the Chefs and Waitstaff at Breakfast we‚Äôre always there to greet us with a smile and outstanding service in the morning as well. And the Housekeeping staff was outstanding as well. Comfort, convenience, food and drink and service- this place has it all!! Five Stars!! ",5
Great food great stay great peoples especially I mentioned two guys SUDHANSHU AND GAGAN in 17th floor giving a great service highly recommend 5star for this hotel and looking forward just before two guys,5
"Me and my husband visited this place, since it is in gurgaon, way closer to our workplaces, it was easier to manage the things from here. Talking about the location, it very close to Manesar toll, you can see the building as soon as you cross the toll, on Delhi jaipur highway.  The guest services are amazing, the staff is courteous and warm. we asked for some in room special arrangements for our special occasion and they happily acknowledged our request and arranged the same. my husband was surprised to see the balloons and cake inside..   to our surprise, cake was amazing and my husband immediately fell in love with it.. who is not a fan of sweets.  The breakfast spread is good.. with limited options in veg.. they have asian and continental dishes as well in the buffet with",4
"I like the place, rooms are really good and spacious. Ambience is really nice. I enjoyed the Regency Club inside the hotel. Two guys Gagan & Sudhangshu in that club are very friendly and taking good care of guests.",5
"I was there for last five days. Good hotel with very good stuffs specially in the restaurant, Sachin the little guy who is very active, Moy the beautiful lady and fauzan also very careful about the guests. Everything was ok except power failure in my room!! ",4
"Hotel room is clean and well maintained. The staff is welcoming and very helpful particularly appreciate help from Mr Jeetendre (nice moustache) and also had a really sound service during the breakfast namely from Vardhman,Fauzan and Prakash. Breakfast buffet includes a very good variety;indian , chinese and european. Staying here is getting value for money and will surely come back with my family. Thanks for making our stay so special.",5
Stayed for a night for business purpose. Nice clean hotel. Large spacious rooms and well done amenities. Well spread breakfast . Young energetic employees willing to serve with a smile - smart Hospitality. Overall a very nice experience .,5
Stayed there for friends birthday rooms are specious clean and tidy. Roadside noise travels to room in late hours. Kamlesh floor incharge was very hospitable  and has a smiling face. Kudos for the decoration he did on our request.,5
Hotel services so nice in housekeeping service also excellent and  very well maintained One more thing I need one person is name Kamlesh Kumar I think is housekeeping supervisor or manager he is very understand person quick responsible guy Thanks,5
"The manager of the restaurant Vardhman Sir really offered 7 stars service. I didn‚Äôt like the dinner at the beginning, he realized it. The next two days, he tried his best to find something that match my taste. Very considerate and hospitality staff and service. I highly recommend you chose here and find Vardhman Sir! Nice trip in India! Thanks a lot!",5
I stayed here for one night and I felt that it's a little boring.  No playing zone and no clubbing area. Although the interiors are very good. But there is a need of improvement in making it more lively.,4
"We stayed after a 8 hour flight and needed some TLC after travelling with a toddler. We had booked some massages a few weeks before out arrival to ensure our booking and it was superb. I had a massage by a lovely lady and a facial by a lady called Meena. Both the therapies were very professional. I would highly recommend booking a little treat. We then had a delicious buffet meal in the evening and all the waiters were very hospitable and polite. If you wanted a special dish made, they were more than happy to do so as I wanted some bland pasta for the little one. The breakfast selection is also incredible with lots of variation.  Would definitely book again next time I visit Dehli. ",5
"Its a very good stay and comfortable , clean , very nice , big rooms  Breakfast buffet its international and so nice , the supervisor ( vardhman jain ) he is a very nice person and very kind , he is polittly with gusets  I would prefier to come again next visit for me to india ",5
"Great room, nice view, quite luxurious. Breakfast was amazing, fresh food with a huge range, very good service - we were looked after by Vardhman (and all the staff). I would certainly come back here.",5
I was in room 1036.It‚Äôs was good experience with Hyatt . Food and staff are nice Specially Rajendra from housekeeping who‚Äôs taking care of my stay nice guy with precious smile üòä he‚Äôs deserving person ,5
"Facilities were top notch. Staff was friendly, helpful and fast. Food was very good. The only thing missing is an indoor swimming pool or the existing one but with a heating system to be able to use it during cold weather (too cold to use during India's Feb weather).",5
"We stayed in a 5 star hotel and we got no sleep !! This hotels rents out proudly a functions room, for various business or private events for up to 2000 people. The party is a blast no doubt but hotel guests get no sleep till at least 1 pm with the speakers blasting ! we called 6 times about the noise, finally with tired kids we got transfered to another sector of the hotel where noise levels were not as high. Why could not they put us there before ? Also My daugther waited 40 minutes for overpriced plain spagethi! Like I saw staff was polite, in fact over the top polite, kept asking if we were ok, when really we just wanted to eat and have a good nite sleep !! ",2
Stayed here a few days and enjoyed my time. The breakfast buffet was filled with all sorts of options. The rooms and exercise facility were very good. Staff seemed friendly and helpful. There wasn‚Äôt much around the hotel to walk to but things are building up around the area.,4
"The staff was really warm and hospitable. We enjoyed our 1 day stay at Hyatt Gurgaon. The staff made our special day more special by decorating the room and sending in a yummy cake. The only thing that could be improved is the buffet layout. Both times we had buffet, all dishes were served cold which killed the fun.  Other than that , stay was very comfortable.",3
Awesome property   Great Hospitality   Humble staff  Prashanth from housekeeping and Varthaman from Kitchen District made their presence throughout the saty in terms of taking care of all requirements during the stay.,5
"Last week I had the distinct pleasure of staying 2 night at this superb hotel with my family. Our stay was absolutely perfect. From the kind, courteous and professional staff to the meticulous, comfortable rooms, common areas, regency club and the breakfast buffet; my experience was nothing less than exceptional.  Definitely one of the best among luxury hotels in Gurgaon.    Located in Sector 83, the location is perfect for those who need to be in New Gurgaon.  Newer property, kept extremely clean and and provides you great hospitality.  Front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming. The check in process was smooth.  As a World of Hyatt discoverist member, I was upgraded to a King Suite which is very spacious and comfortable.  The room was spotless and immaculately done.",5
"Hyatt Gurgaon is good hotel, it's staff are very cooperative but you will inhibit your movements because it takes lots of time to commute from Delhi to hotel. Hotel does'nt many restaurants but those which they have, will try to satisfy your hunger.  Hotel is above than average, you can stay in it if you have business near Gurgaon. If you have business in Delhi choose another hotel because it is far from Delhi. Traffic situation and distance will take almost two hours of your precious time going to Delhi and two hours while returning, in a working day.",3

"As lifelong Starwood (now Marriott) Elite members, we have stayed at just about all the major Marriott brands all over the world, Le Meridien being one of our favorites.   Our stay in Le Meridien Gurgaon is a relatively long one, so we have had the time to really check it out properly. To put it simply, our experience has been outstanding so far - the front desk, the housekeeping ... but most of all the food!  All major starred hotels in India have a large breakfast buffet, but we are finding Le Meridien's notable for its sheer quality and service. Each and every dish is made with care and authenticity. For example, unlike many other Delhi NCR hotels which tend to skew all dishes towards a Punjabi / Mughlai palate, here the South Indian dishes taste genuinely from the South.  ",5
We came in this hotel for staycation with family members and enjoyed our stay very much despite of very busy break fast and so much of people .Hotel seems very busy but the staff of the hotel is very courteous and eager to help .Anjali the lobby guest relation extremely helpful and always available with beautiful smile .Anuj Tyagi from concierge who arranged our stuff from outside which was noy easily available.Thanks to Anjali and Anuj Tyagi,5

Special commendation for Anjali at front office, who has been cordial everytime i have met her and she does her best to receive feedbacks from every customer, which is something I wish other hotels would follow suit and regularly engage with guest.   as for negatives, there aren‚Äôt much but the foods in buffet are not consistent and the same dish have different texture and taste every other day. the hotel location is also kinda far if you are expecting to visit delhi, so it will take almost 30-50 mins to reach any destination in south Delhi, though",5

"Right from the front desk onwards,  everything was horrible.   1. Poorly trained guy handling front desk.  Despite a confirmed room upgrade on email, didn't bother upgrading which I assumed will be automatically done if I have an email.   2. No mini bar - bizzarely enough the meridien room had no mini bar.  A basic at most hotels  3. When I complained about the room not being the upgraded one despite email, had no idea how to talk to customer.  Even the duty manager Ritika didn't seem well trained.    All in all I'd say this hotel is best avoided.  Stay very very far away from this horrid property.  Doesn't feel like a Marriott owned property at all.",1

However,  bad choice of hotel ended up spoiling a weekend getaway which we so thoughtfully decided to plunge into. I think they are booked beyond their capacity,  training and professionalism to handle because I am an ardent follower of Trip Advisor,  the reviews I had read were amazing however given the experience today I was taken back. The front desk was swift though with check in  but luggage needed another 2 rounds from us till reception to ensure it reaches us.  The worst started with us ordering from in dining room service of the hotel. Their online menu offers limited menu,  on checking they confirmed they will send us detailed menu on phone.  Half an hour and 3 calls",1

Not only were the rooms clean and well maintained, the house keeping staff, ESPECIALLY RAMAVTAR, made sure I was stocked up on essentials.  I made a girl gang with the women staff!

Started with a good note ,the room was well decorated for our anniversary stay over ,though a laid back house keeping service brought this to a low level clubbed with breakfast on the first day when placards for non veg and veg were messed up leading us to eat up non veg whereas we are pure vegetarian! We extended our stay before this happened else would not have bothered to move out to another hotel! I was thinking of not staying at this property next time until I came across delightful service provided my Mr Samarth during our breakfast on 19th, exemplary service making me believe my sour experience the previous day was just one off! Keep up the good work with same zeal and passion! Housekeeping needs some improvement though",5

"Good clean room. Comfortable bed. Tasty food. Friendly staffs..and they didn‚Äôt haggle to be tipped(to my surprise). Informative concierge. Not much to do/activity around the radius. Breakfast buffet can be a little intimidating, many local office workers and businessmen were talking inconsiderately loud.",5
I wanted to request for Rajasthani food and Mr Jitesh Sharma went out of the way in assuring that the food ordered was as per our choice and he was very prompt with his convincing replies. Jitesh ensured that the ordering process / payments etc went off smoothly and that explained every meal / dish aspect to us.,5
"Clean and comfortable both room and whole hotel, friendly staff, good food and very cooperative waiters, fast internet, all workers stick with Corona Virus procedures, complimentary mineral water provided.",4
"Hotel staff lied during the reservation and attempted to commit fraud. Employees included duty manager Vikram Kapoor. Others included Anoop, Nitesh, and Ravi.  My mother was traveling from England to Delhi and as per Indian law during COVID, she is supposed to quarantine for 7 days at government listed hotels only. The staff lied to us about their hotel qualified for this purpose and took my credit card details. Apparently, the hotel was ""de-listed"" as a qualified hotel for quarantine travelers several weeks ago (reason is unknown).  When my mother reached the airport, the immigration officer denied access to the hotel given that it was not in their list and it caused a lot of stress and hectic last minute for her. She is old and had to find + reserve hotel after almost 16 hrs.",1
"Good day everyone,  This is a letter from a disappointed customer who had suggested his family choose Le Meridien Hotels over other hotels for his sister-in-law's wedding.   To start with, I would like to simply put that your hotel in Gurgaon is nowhere near a 5-star property as claimed by your staff. As per my understanding & fairly considerable experience, the 5-star property is a luxury property in all areas of operations where the guests can enjoy personalized services. Your property is atrociously mediocre with no attention to detail.   1. Your coordinator kept calling us right before the start of the event to clear the payment like a debt collector in spite of receiving 32.5% of the payment at the time of booking. We were getting ready to reach the event but had to take a",1
I have stayed in the hotel many times before covid-19 pandemic and checked in again after the lock down .The H√¥tel is following all the guide lines of social distancing and fantastic standard in new covid world for the safety and security for the guests and staff which is very pleasant .Would like to mention the Cheif Concierge Anuj T√Ω√£g√Æ and happy to see him who welcomed me again and one of the reason to come back to Le Meridien Gurgaon all the times .,5
"My Stay in Le‚ÄôMeridien. I don‚Äôt have words to show how grateful and Thankful I am for everyone there. My stay in hotel was from 7-Mar to 11-May. I was planned to leave India on 4 April but unfortunately lockdown happened.  During these uncertain times I found this place to be the safest place. Each and everyone went beyond their duty to make everyone who was in hotel. It‚Äôs the smalls things that these amazing people do that makes you smile and feel safe. Like Surya from housekeeping, who checks everyday whether there is anything that can be done or simply comes to ask how I am. Or the In-room dining staffs Mangaldheep & Johor who is always smiling and bringing the fine cuisine of delicacies to room and ask about my Ramadan fasting. The whole team of Rahul who is always smiling",5
"My stay for four nights will always be  a memorable one. The spirit of hospitality especially during these testing times needs special mention. The young team of front office, Housekeeping and Food & Beverages were always seen spirited and cheerful. Lot of emphasis on hygiene. The meals and service were exemplary.Thank you team Meridian.",5
"We ordered a buffet meal for our family from Le Meridien yesterday. I have to say, it was one of the best meal deliveries we‚Äôve had. The food was just amazing! The variety of the items on the menu catered to everyone in the family and the quantities were quite generous. I think it‚Äôs goin to be our go-to option at least once a month. Highly recommend!",5
"I have been staying in Le Meridien Gurgaon, Delhi NCR since 9th March 2020, I was staying alone here on a business trip, during this time my wife and daughter joined me on 13th March with plans to return back to Malaysia after 5 days. We had a great trip to Taj Mahal and visiting all great places in Delhi (Rajghat, India Gate, Janpath, Sansad, etc) on this weekend. But unfortunately, the lockdown started in India, and flight services were cancelled due to COVID-19 lockdown in both India and Malaysia. So, we all held up in this hotel in Gurgaon. At the same time, we found this hotel is the safest place due to the fact that all necessary COVID-19 precautions are taken strictly, giving priority to everyone's health safety and hygiene to ensure all guests are safe. Due to lockdown,",5
"The hotel is very nice. Location near the airport, which by the way is very convenient. The rooms are nice, every day we had perfect cleanliness for which thanks to the staff. Breakfast is very tasty, there is a big chose of European dishes. Cool pool and gym. You can also go for a massage in the spa. Top-level staff - quickly resolve issues if any. It is one of the best hotel.",5
"During these challenging times of the global coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent country wide lockdown, I found myself checked into Le M√©ridien Gurgaon. I never could imagine I would be caught in a hotel due to a situation so stressful and overwhelming.  I was initially very concerned if the hotel would manage to keep afloat in the face of such uncertainty.  After the first day of lockdown the hotel managers visited each guest to insure we were safe and sound and the hotel would remain operating. I never felt so relieved in my entire life. They also guaranteed they would follow the strictest measures of cleanliness and hygiene in accordance with given health guidelines.  It was clear that our safety and well being would be of utmost importance.  Now 27 days into lockdown and",5
Me and my family staying here since 9th Feb 2020 and its been more than 45 days of stay in this hotel. From 1st day onwards their housekeeping services was not good. It was worst. We gave a feedback also then they deployed Mr.Sanjay to look after the housekeeping services for our room. For almost 7-8 days Mr.sanjay was there and at that time the cleaning was excellent but when this COVID 19 lockdown started Mr.Sanjay was given leave then again the services became worst. Today one person named Anshul came with a notice that now the housekeeping services will be alternate days. Being a doctor I said them that hygiene is of utmost importance at present and you are doing that thing alternate. It will lead to problems for all guests. In daily housekeeping only they are not sanitizing,1
"Well something good which coronavirus did is given back people some time to complete pending tasks.. Having said that, this review had been pending for long but I am satisfied that atleast I am doing it now.  So, I visited Le Meridien Gurgaon on January 26th to celebrate my anniversary. To attend us, came a charming lady ""Anne"" on the front desk and helped us check in. During the process, she got to know that me and my wife are expecting so she personally ensured that my wife feels comfortable.. She not only ensured that everything is perfect but also was so sweet to call and check multiple times if my wife needed something specific per her needs for her to be comfortable during the stay. She also surprised us by getting our room decorated and arranged a special cake for us to",5
Chef Ajay and his team did a fantastic job and gave us one of the best beetroot galauti as well fish Tikka. We thoroughly enjoyed the pan seared sea bass. We love coming to this place as we are very fond of their a la carte as well as corporate and Sunday brunch buffet. ,5
"Highly impressed by the food and staff at Latest Recipe. It was my first time there for lunch. The buffet spread was massive. Mr Ranjeet Singh and Aayushi were really nice and took very good care. Chef Ajay specially got a tomato soup made for me instead of the mushroom soup that they had in the buffet. Chef  Anuj prepared amazing pasta for us. The Indian food was very well prepared with less oil. Overall, the staff is very courteous and welcoming. They do their best to make you enjoy your meal. If there is anything that you want not available in the buffet and can be prepared, Chef Vikram and Chef Mayank would take the pain to do so. Special thanks to Nagesh for serving us with so much love. Would like to thank the entire team at Latest Recipe for a real good afternoon.",5
"Hi, there,   I am a business man and I have traveled to India, New Delhi many times. Usually I will stay at Westin Hotel in New Delhi. But, I had chosen Le Meridien Hotel at Gurgaon.   There are two Le Meridien Hotels. The other one is Le Meridien Hotel, New Delhi. My customer took me to this hotel and then found out it was a mistake. The hotel staff was also nice and called Le Meridien at Gurgaon to confirm my booking at their hotel.  After arrived at Le Meridien Hotel at Gurgaon, the doorman had opened the door for me and smiled to me. It gave me a good impression. When I checked in, the front desk lady, Ms. Chandni was taking care of my check in. She had upgraded my room to a suite room and then took me to my room and explained and shown the function of the room for me. She",5
"I had a long stay on a business trip. All the staff were kind and meticulous in my room condition. The staff Supriya who helped me from check-in checked my requirements in detail and helped me apply them to my room care. Both the lounge and breakfast buffet were excellent, and despite their long stay, there was nothing uncomfortable about the food. I could not use the swimming pool because of the weather, but I could see cleaning the pool every day when he was working out in the gym. It would be nice to visit this comfortable and convenient place for customers.",5
"This is one of the best Marriot property I have stayed at. Very well maintained , Spick and Span , Staff is super cordial , affectionate and hospitality at its extreme and the best.

The hotel offers Pick and drop facility at reasonable pricing, You get the transfers complementary if u opt for a club room. Bella cucina their speciality restaurent is really worth trying. The staffs are very helpful and polite. ",5
"Stayed here for 3 days in July 2019 and it left a good impression for sure. The room was very nice, breakfast was fabulous and the service was warm too. The location is a bit out of the way and there isn't much to do around if you get out. However, the hotel more than makes up for it, I think. Would come back for sure, if I get the opportunity.",4
"I had the dinner buffet at the hotel which I found very good, but you would like something else after some days. Why not ask the chefs to make something special for you? I asked Ajay for some pasta with pesto and he made it for me. Great! The next Ajay prepared some very good looking Sushi for me. The taste was excellent. Ram prepared some great wok meatballs (sorry for not knowing the name) that was so good tasting. From the Indian kitchen Vinod gave me advice what to put on my plate. Thank you! But I will also give my ""personal"" waiter Sunil my compliments for knowing my name, always smile and know what I like to drink :)",5

"I recently spent 2 nights at Le Meridien Gurgaon, Delhi NCR. The hotel is nice. There are 3 dining areas - the main buffet (you can also have a la carte here), an Italian restaurant and a roof top restaurant that is actually not part of the hotel so you have to pay separately here. We had an early evening cocktail on the restaurant veranda  (mine was awful but probably a bad choice on my part!). Sadly the restaurant was empty so there was little ambience and we decided not to stay for supper. We then went the buffet restaurant on the ground floor. There is lots of choice but as is often the case in buffets the food is a bit cold - I should have chosen a la carte. Having said that the food was good. The WORST bit BY FAR  however was that there was a couple singing. They were",3
Compact but functional rooms. Airport transport may be included if you book the right reservation.  My biggest gripe is the food. Very limited non veg Indian food options for breakfast. We also order some chicken shawarma one night and it was terrible. It's just plain grilled chicken in a wrap. That's quite a disappointment.  Hotel staff is very nice and helpful though! Allowed us to do early check-in which saved our lives.  Gym is really nice. ,4
"Food is very  tasty , and very good. Spread of buffet ,i feel like home ,excellent environment , specially thanks to chef sayali  she's taking care to all guest ,very good nature ,she makes me  very comfortable, good service ayushi , chef sonal also very good",5
"It was a 2N stay and I didn‚Äôt have much time to go for sightseeing. We arvd late, almost 5pm. Charming staffs esp Ritika, Ayushi, Prakthtap, Vikki and the lovable beautiful chef Sayali. As for food i think the Indian  variations are good and tasty. Love their lacha parotha very much. Close to MGF Megacity Mall for those who dont have much time to shop for local made souvenirs. Lots of good eats in there too. Catch an Uber or hotel taxi to get there. ",4
"Third time around. Staff always nice. Buffet breakfast is of good variety and quality.  Gets busy so, should time well when you choose to go. Evening buffet is expensive for what is on offer. A la cart also expensive.  Rooms looking tired and needs a refresh.  Hotel needs better housekeeping around the grounds.  Gym is good size and hairdresser was fantastic.",3
"Great place and service. Excellent food and bar, knowledgeable staff in catering and serving. Great location on mountain. Excellent place to have a get together or a wedding. Only downside is their vallet parking service. They are hell bent to park your car n won't let you park it. Very inflexible their policies are Room size and amenities are of all the international standards. Their bath tubs are little bigger than average size so long baths are awesome. For my next visit to Delhi, I would definitely choose to stay here. Also, for restaurant Bella cucina, chef is from Naples so you get the perfect bread and pizza.",4
Awesome food lavish buffet giant spread some privacy and courteous staff is all you need to make your anniversary lunch special and that what Latest Recepie did to us when we visited for our anniversary lunch. Thanks Le Meridian for making it memorable,4
"Our stay was awsome, starting from valet to checkout!  If you're visiting this hotel, we would recommend to meet Anuj Tyagi (Chief Concierge), Ashish Kumar (Concierge) & Sahibaan (Front Desk) for an awsome experience.   These people are polite, friendly and very helpful!  They got our room decorated and arranged a complimentary cake for our anniversary which is a very warm gesture and no doubt the food was amazing.",5

"Hosted my wedding at Le Meridien Gurgaon in November. Had a pleasant stay for 3 nights with the entire family.   All the venues are very nice with distinguishing features. The ballroom, terrace, i-kandy (poolside) all have their own different vibe to it.   The food in particular, whether it may be buffet at Latest Recipe or the specially curated menu for the functions, was very well done.  Special thanks to Sukirti for all the assistance before and during the entire event.  The new Old Delhi Restaurant at the longitude deck is a 'not miss'. They serve the most sumptuous and delightful kebabs.  Overall, it was a well-coordinated and delightful stay.",4
"The overall experience with the hotel was pleasant. Check-in was quick and efficient. Rooms were decent, but small in comparison with similar hotels in the vicinity. Breakfast had a  good spread, and was very sumptuous too. Service standards were pretty high too. Look forward to my next visit.",4
"I have been staying at Le Meridien Gurgaon about a week per month for the last year and it is the staff that make the place special. As a frequent visitor you get access to the lounge at the 11th floor, where you can eat the buffet food or have food from the room service menu delivered. In the lounge the staff give the personal touch, remember your name, know how you like your drinks, make jokes and are happy to talk about there home states, families, etc. Across the road is the biodiversity park, a great place for bird watching, bouldering and top rope solo climbing.",5
The hotel provides great hospitality. The staff was extremely friendly especially Mr. Anuj Tyagi and Ms. Anne. Customer satisfaction is their top priority. The rooms were not that spacious but they provide you with all the modern facilities. It is absolutely a city-centered property wherein you are just a walk away from the shopping junctions.,4
It is an awesome hotel - situated in the right location!!!  The food in the restaurant is awesome - the chef takes personal care of kids in particular and the menu is superb...not to mention the live music that was on offer --- overall a very good experience.,4
It was really awesome visit to the hotel really enjoyed the dinner special thanks Shubham and Jatin         Will be back soon thanks everyone there the staff       Really thanks to all the staff who‚Äôd advise you visit ,5
"Visited for a buffet dinner on 13th Feb,2020.This was our anniversary dinner.Though hotel is fine and staff is also good but the quality of food was below average very unlike a five star.Cant point out even one dish that is worth a mention.Spread was also less.It was a very disappointing experience.Hope my review finds the right ears and something is done to improve.",3
"The staffs were amazing and made all efforts to ensure comfortable stay! Excellent restaurant, good cocktails in the bars, nice gym and other amenities to indulge. Conveniently located to all places in NCR.",5
"I'm from Wisconsin. First time in India. For business.  Sunny and Anjali in the lounge were great.  Ask them anything!    The concierge set up a day trip to Taj for us, hassle free.  Chef Apa and the wine director (forgot your name!) in the Italian restaurant are beyond words.  We were invited to order off the menu, introduced too new wines, and had an amazing fine dining experience. The gnocchi are pillows of clouds that melt in your mouth.",5
"I have stayed in Le MERIDIEN GURGAON for a long time and the services are fantastic.

I'm first time visit to india Le Meridien Hotel Staff is very friendly Very Nice Breakfast & Room condition & good gym but The environment is not good   The staff are very friendly and will stay here next time,5
"What matters to me the most is time to check-in and check-out, this place ensures that is not something one needs to worry about. Everything is taken care of as per preference, you just have to get there.  The lounge is cozy and has a good view, perfect for a morning quiet breakfast. What I like the most is the color tone of the room, its light and bright and highly functional. Of course, the guest relations team ensures things move according to your plan.",5
"Had a lovely stay at Le M√©ridien last week. Spacious rooms, squeaky clean public areas, super quick service from in room dining and housekeeping. Anurag, the duty manager personally ensured that we were well looked after. Will keep coming back every time we‚Äôre in NCR. ",5
"I spent 3 nights at the Le Meridien in Gurgaon and the overall experience was very good. The hotel is situated in Guargaon in quite an open area with not many tall buildings around, so there is a feeling of space around the hotel (which is very unique for Delhi and Gurgaon). The reception and common areas are open and spacious and the room was neat and functional.....Not luxurious, but well above the 70% mark of most hotels I have stayed at. Breakfast was good, a wide selection of Indian and Western food, though the service at breakfast was a touch slow. The highlight of the stay were the kebabs we ate which were prepared in fact of us by Chefs on a wood fire outside on the terrace. Amazingly delicious! I will be back.",4
"Hotel is beautiful! the staff are really amazing nice people!!with passion and smile for you!!! top hotel.We loved the design of the rooms and hotel in general, very modern and stylish. Big rooms and bathroom. Very nice welcome at arrival and actually always when arriving at the hotel. Breakfast was good too. Will book it again when back in New Delhi.",4
"I had a wonderful stay at this property.  As a Titanium member, I was given an amazing suite upgrade.  Not only that the staff everywhere was just terrific. Great executive lounge.  Superb breakfast with many made-to-order items, including Indian specialties and chocolate waffles and pancakes made with chocolate batter.",5
"I have been to Delhi many times, and have come to Le Meridien Gurgaon my last 3 trips. I will say that This hotel is hands down the best. The service is impeccable. And I truly feel valued and appreciated for my Ambassador Elite status.   The staff is amazingly friendly. Annie, the guest relation executive was extremely accommodating, and always had a smile on her face. Anuj as well would always great me with a smile. Up in the lounge Anjali, Rohit and Krishna were the best.  While the flight is long from the US, knowing I get to stay at the Le Meridien makes the whole trip worth it. This is one of the best hotels. And this comes from someone who stays in a hotel nearly 140 nights per year.   Thank You!",5
"If you‚Äôre staying here, try to make time to sit & relax at the Club Lounge on the 11th Floor. Well lighted, service is excellent and the staff there are very helpful / courteous. Special appreciation for Rahul and Anjali - who are the Managers of the Lounge. Well done Le Meridien !! ",5
"From the point of check-in itself I came to know about the hospitality standards of the place. Rishabh from front desk was very helpful and polite. I  was celebrating anniversary while I was travelling there, informed about the same to housekeeping. CHITRA UJJAINWAL and GANESH from the hk department decorated the bed very beautifully with rose petals and foliage. Both of them did exceptionally well and went an extra mile.Later CHITRA also arranged for some balloons and placed them accordingly.However, my stay was good overall and I look forward to visit the property again in near future.",5
My dinner experience was amazing. Food ambience & live music was so good . Especially the chef MR. Vinod provided me tiramisu even when it was not in the buffet menu. Highly appreciate his hospitality üëçüèª,4
"I can't mention any unsatisfied points for my stay at Le Meridien Gurgaon, Delhi NCR. Amazing Check-in experience and the room was so clean with comfortable bed. Special thanks to Rahul and Amuel at the executive lounge for giving so many good advice for my trip and taking care of my demands so seriously. Breakfast at the restaurant was so nice! Every staff there was so friendly and working so professionally. Vinod was always there for making sure my desired dishes were served on time. I will definitely come back again if any chance to go visit Delhi again.",5
"We stayed here for 1 night after an overnight flight from Europe. Our flight had been delayed and the hotel kindly changed our two night reservation to just one night at late notice. We were able to check in mid morning after arrival. Staff were welcoming and courteous. The hotel is fundamentally Ok but falls short in some areas on quality for the upscale reputation of Meridien Hotels and the higher end of the Marriott group. Comfortable bed and room, bathroom is functional but is showing too many signs of age and needs attention. We arrived during a cold spell and had to ask for supplementary heating for our room which was provided promptly. The foyer, bar area and main restaurant was cold and unsuitable to spend any time in.  We had access to the concierge lounge where staff",4
I was only planning to stay for a single night and then move to a location which was closer to my work place. After receiving top quality service at the lounge I decided to travel every day and cancelled my other booking just to enjoy the hotel ambience and hospitality.  Overall it was a great people experience.,4
"I was staying at the Le Meridien Gurgaon for the third time, and have become used to the pleasant experience offered here. Though the hotel is away from the shopping area of M G Road, the exemplary service compensates for this.  Prateek (I might have missed the name) handled my check-in. He always enquired whether my stay is comfortable and also insisted I try out the Lounge. The restaurant manager Mr. Nikhil Verma is a very cheerful person. He was very earnest in checking everything was fine and made sure I got my breakfast promptly. Chef Sayali was awesome. She inquired about my food preferences and customized the preparations accordingly. Kudos to her efforts as introverts like me don't share their preferences easily.

"We had a 5-night stay at Le Meridien for a friend's wedding and booked at Le Meridien as part of the wedding block. That said, we were absolutely thrilled that the wedding party had a block at Le Meridien. From the front desk staff and concierge, to the warm servers (Shubham, Sunil, and Deepak) and chefs (Anuj and Vinod), we truly felt taken care of from the minute we arrived. The staff at the hotel even gave us a Bon Voyage cake on our last day at the hotel! The hotel had everything an American traveler could need when traveling for an Indian wedding, including an in-house tailor to do some last minute saree ironing and a spa attendant who could wrap a saree. We were very sad to leave and loved every minute of our stay at the Le Meridien!",5
"First of all, the property is gorgeous. Very safe, expect all cars to pass through security at the gate before approaching the hotel. Clean, modern, fancy hotel with comfortable rooms. Aside from the material comfort of the facilities, I honestly can't say enough about how incredible the staff is. People waiting to open the door upon your arrival/return, kind and knowledgeable concierges, the most friendly and eager food staff - everyone is genuine and greets with the warmest of hospitality making you feel like royalty.   Particular shout out to Shubham and Anuj from dining who every morning for breakfast made sure to come over and say hello and bring us treats they thought we would like based on what we'd eaten and enjoyed before - even bringing us a 'bon voyage' dessert on our",5
"We came to this hotel for our friends wedding and it is a fantastic space, we extended our trip here for several days because we loved it so much. I have to especially note from the cooking staff Ajay, who has taken care of us and been fantastic in the morning making us feel at home.",5
"If you are looking for excellent buffet and good rooms, this is it! Neat and clean. They prefer to use card as they short of cash change most of the time as everything is via mobile pay nowadays in Delhi.",5
"We organized alunch buffet for a corporate event in our office and ordered it from Le Meridian. The food was excellent and so was the service. Their Indian and continental menu encompasses good spread of dishes. Both attendants Kamlesh and  Ankit were very professional in servicing. All logistics, cutlery, etc were very well taken care off.",5

"Anuj Tyagi, is the exact reason you choice the Le Meridien. When I lost my passport and was getting no where and it seemed I would be stuck for days. Anuj and the staff at the Le Meridan jumped into action. I could not ask for better service. I have stayed through out the world and this was truly world class service. Thanks again Anuj and staff for helping us have a great time in Delhi.",5
"We had a great experience at Le Meridian Gurgaon while organizing our annual event this October.  We had a Director's conference for 03 days and a Diwali bash after that. Everything was managed with utmost care and food was exceptionally sumptuous. I would like to mention great efforts by Parth Dhall, Sajiya Bano, Chef Ramji, Abhinav Bhardwaj & Vishwajeet Singh for their contribution in making our event a huge success.  They went out of their way to make things turnaround 'our way' on short notices. Thank you & Keep up the good work Team LM!!!",5
"This property is a Pullman that has been converted, and it shows when you stay here. The rooms are really tiny for a Le Meridien brand, and making it worse, it is not even sound proofed to stop music and sound from their own terrace entering their rooms when they host events at the hotel.  It is badly kept with renovation work overdue, which can be seen from the marks and damages popping up on the mirrors and the rooms in general. The staff can be a hit and miss based on who you interact with... I have had the experience of talking to some very warm, friendly and nice staff members, while i have also experienced a super cold welcome to the hotel which is extremely rare anywhere as a Marriott titanium member. Staying at the hotel as i write this review, with really loud",2
just spent 3 nights here and as per other reviews the highlight is the personal experience from the staff. Also had 2 evenings of personal dining for my business guests outside and the food and service from Chef Khan and his team was outstanding.  Great return visit and will be back soon!,5
We recently stayed here for almost 14 nights. The hotel is excellent and staff and service is amazing. Kudos to Anuj Tyagi and his entire concierge team that went beyond their duty to provide excellent service. The driver Rajesh Yadav was extremely good and took us all over the place and very knowledgeable about the places that we visited.,5
A fantastic and extra hospitable staff. Beautiful property and our overall experience was overwhelming. A special mention to Mr. Nitesh and Ms Annie for being highly cooperative. Looking forward for our next stay at this beautiful place,5
"Stayed for one Friday night. Hotel location makes it a bit of its own island which is not a problem by itself. Loved the fact everything is designed in a white theme which gives a fresh modern look the minute you enter the lobby. The rooms where the less positive part of the stay. they are small and are very outdated. Our room showed its age with a wallpaper that started to peel off the wall and a bathroom that can't be cleaned well anymore (water stains, aging tub). The food we ate and the service all together were excellent.",4
"We had the best time staying here because of the staff!! They were the most incredible people we have had the pleasure of staying with. Rahul was so helpful and informative, and even gave me a parting gift of masala chai! Anjali also sent me home with some Assam tea to try. Kartic served us with a smile every day, and Chef Sunny‚Äôs food was incredible! He even made us special Indian desserts to try. Stay here if you want to meet these amazing people! ",5
"My wife and I only had one full day and evening at the Le Meridien before leaving Delhi but it was one of the finest hotel stays we have ever had, anywhere (and we travel extensively). The entire staff was superb making our stay comfortable and memorable.  Service was surperb from the moment we checked in with our personal conceriege Annie to Angelin in the executive lounge, along with Chef Sunny and waiter's like Karick who provided friendly and professional service in the executive lounge.  The staff was so attenative and service oriented they even went out to get Guavas for my wife, prepared them and brought to our room.  If you want to stay in an oasis with special service, don't miss this hotel.",5
"The Hotel was Ok...visited during a rush hour. Not too much activities nearby the hotel to do, any activities like going to mall or some dining option etc; one must travel via taxi. Got a high floor and a good view room.",4
"On my first visit to Delhi, I was pleased that I chose the Le Meridien hotel. The staff is,very friendly and helpful. My room was clean and well appointed, plenty of bottled water, great toiletries. The room was cleaned every day. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom and big shower, which for me was very important. The breakfast buffet in the morning was very nice selection of local food, and traditional eggs and bacon.",5
"I am a Marriott Titanium Elite Lifetime member. I have traveled the world staying in Marriotts.  Service at this hotel was the BEST I have EVER experienced. It was like each employee was in a contest to out perform the others in services. From the Front Desk, Concierge, Cleaning Staff, Restaurant Staff, and even the Drivers. It was AMAZING! The management staff of this hotel must be CONGRATULATED on what they have done to create a world-class experience at the Le Meridien Gurgaon Delhi India hotel!",5
Unbelievable!  I travel about 150 days a year so plenty of hotel time. This is one of the best experiences I've had.    The hotel is old and nothing close to walk to. So I really didn't expect much.  But!  The staff are just incredible. I had a warm welcome from Annie that immediately set the standard. She welcomed me at the car and guided me to my room. From there every interaction was above and beyond expectation.   Hitesh in the Italian restaurant proudly told me about the breads they make each day and baked in the oven. Giving me samples to try.  Then Rahul and Anmol in the 11th floor lounge couldn't do enough to make me comfortable while I worked.  Kartic made me cocktails and Sailey the chef heard I like local Indian food so procedure to make me a special meal.  Finally I,5

"Great buffet food restaurant, excellent staff serving but no sleep on either Wednesday, Thursday, I‚Äôm told Friday and Saturday then come here. A fantastic week ruined due to a wedding venue Wednesday to Saturday. Music policy is finish by midnight yet still pumping at 1.30am.

"I stayed 8 weeks and I will never book ever again this hotel, neither for free.

The result?  My feedback is strongly negative. never again.",1
"I did a road trip from Chandigarh to Delhi and then attended a business meeting with my colleagues. Took an Uber came to this beautifully decorated property. I saw this man doing nothing when my cab was waiting at valet. There were at least 5-7 cars in a row and the least Karan could have done is shown some leadership skills and moved some of the cars or asked someone. When I asked him couldn't you would have helped, his response 'i am conceirge, that's security teams work'.  Then vaibhav comes and addresses me as platinum guest, when it's written in the guest details that I am titanium. Didn't greet me or thank me to be a titanium member until the time he charged my card.  Ashish, on the other hand during that time was talking over phone ' yaar ye bhi to karna hai'. Can't you",2

"This is a great hotel, a little removed from the noise of Gurgaon. Amongst the great facilities the hotel has to offer is a great Italian restaurant. Chef Vikas and his team in the kitchen produce some great dishes with real attention to detail; celeriac and artichoke gratin served alongside an incredibly tasty buffalo steak was a stand out. The team in the restaurant including Jitesh and Hitesh do a great job making a solo visitor feel comfortable and welcome.",5

I received very useful information for our visit to Delhi and nearby places at front desk. The guest relations manager Mr. Anuj Tyagi has provided very detailed information about various places to visit and many useful suggestions.   The size of the rooms are bit smaller may be by few square feet. The upkeep of room and bathroom are very good. The restaurant staff are eager to prepare and serve food of our choice. One of the staff members Sayali at the Latest Recipe restaurant has offered us many varieties of food for the breakfast.",5
"Stayed at the hotel for business for 1 week, the hotel is very comfortable but what I really appreciated is the kindness of the staff. Warm, and welcoming. A very pleasant stay, albeit the location is a bit odd (nothing around) and although the hotel seems fairly new, some details feels dated (bad building quality?).",4

I generally stay at the le meridien when in gurgaon given their excellent service but they always exceed my expectations.I wish to highlight a staff member named Anjali at the Club Lounge on 11th floor who went out of her way and took exceptional care during my visit. I was impressed with her dedication to service . She is indeed a very valuable resource . Well Done!!,5
"I was super impressed by the hospitality of the staff at the hotel as they performed all the tasks efficiently while taking extra care of all the guests.

I booked 9 nights stay with this hotel however on the day of travel I got very sick. I sent email request for cancellation along with doctor certificate.

"Nice property. Excellent staff, prompt service and good food at the Italian restaurant! View of greenery from the room is great! What I really didn't like is the size of the room . There is no doorway and the moment one opens the room door, it gives a very small room feel, it actually is small in any case. Really does not justify the tariff. The study desk and the bed is so close, there is hardly any room to put the chair. One will have to keep the chair aside to move inside the room. That too I have stayed in a Club room. During check in, the check in staff proudly claimed that I have been upgraded to a Club room. Amazing! I told him that I have booked a Club room only at a higher tariff. Wonder then why didn't he upgrade me to the next higher cat room! During checkout I",3
"I have now had multiple stopovers at the Meridien coffee shop. It‚Äôs well made and the facade and the porch are so inviting. The best is the location - absolutely on the Delhi Gurgaon border with both cities within reach. Set up near the Aravalis , the hotel gives a fabulous view. ",5
"My company ran a conference in a hall at G floor (I think it means groumd floor). Space we used and the services of hotel faculty were very nice!  There was little misunderstanding when my manager payed for the charges which is why I gave 4 stars. Howerver, considering that we were foreign business people for the hotel, it is understandable. Except that, it was satisfactory.",4

Me and my friends had a great time and we would like to thank some exceptionally dedicated team members namely Mr. Rahul  a truly focused and capable front desk manager as he had given us very good rooms and also Sanchit from room service,he was also there in the club lounge serving us.

"Arriving at Le Meridien Gurgaon after a not too pleasant experience through Delhi Airport, the team at the hotel made for a drastic contrast in how welcome they made me feel. From the moment, I was quickly checked in and offered a ready room early in the morning.  The attentive presence of Anjali and Rohit in the lounge always made for a happy conversation to distract me from my busy day. The hospitality of the LeMeridien Gurgaon team deserves to be commended.",5

My stay here was most pleasant. The rooms are breath of fresh air. I loved the interiors and wish i could have stayed longer. The bathroom and room amenities are perfect and premium as well. Super clean room and house keeping is top notch.  Breakfast buffet spread was vast and the top chef walks around checking on guests. We had a nice little chat and he seemed genuinely interested in the making improvements based on guest's feedback  Reception staff are cordial and quite helpful as well. They answered all our queries on the city and check in /check out was a breeze.  Wifi connection was strong and i did not have any issues.  Overall a perfect stay here!,5
"I have been to quite a number of Le Meridien hotel in around the world, plus many other Marriott Group hotels, and I must say that Le Meridien at Gurgaon is one of the best I have been to so far, in term of the professionalism, caring and the pleasant attitude of the staff!  Absolutely impressive!!! I must also say that the F&B team are doing a fabulous job on taking care the restaurants of the hotel, really amazing! ",5

Their standard of hospitality is miles ahead of their competitors like Taj ‚Ä¶  hence I always prefer to stay here . I would certainly recommend all business / holiday  travelers to explore this property.",5
"Thanks to the staff of LeMeridien, my stay was beyond my expectations. Staff made every possible effort to make me feel like home. I called them at 3 am to fix room temperature, and they did it in 5 minutes. Also allowed me to have breakfast before 6.30 am as I had a flight to board. There are so many good things to say, but to summarise I would stay here again when I'm in Delhi and would recommend everyone to explore this property of Le Meridien and excellent service by staff.  Special thanks to Vandana Kanojia, for sure sending hot water and tea regularly to my room, as I was going through weather allergy. I really appreciate yours and Le Meridien's staff efforts for my wonderful stay.",5
"What a surprise this place was. Stayed here because I had to surprise my family. The staff is polite, humble and courteous. They go out of their way to make the guest at home. The service here was better than any Oberoi hotel I have used-that means a lot and I have communicated my opinikns to the senir management privately. The young bartender from Uttarakhand deserves a special mention. So does Rishabh at reception, all the reception staff and the breakfast service staff. You ask for something and it comes-whether its a request for lamb curry during breakfast(yes, I wanted it-crazy!) or bottles of water -they deliver and double check that you are taken care off.   Would love to make this my regular stay. I am amazed and very happy.  Rooms are modern, all fittings in bath are",5

"It was not so good stay. The thing that I liked the most was the lobby of the hotel...elegantly designed. The room was spacious and well lit. There was no disturbing sound of any kind. We booked Hotel transfers by online - no problem there, but after that was just one nightmare to another. only one problem which we felt disgraced upon arrival at airport despite being told we waited for 10 mins for our transfer, When the representative akash Akshay (not sure?) did arrive rather than saying sorry He repeatably used his phone whilst talking, I was booked for 2 persons, and i had confirmation email for that. The representative ask my husband name and my husband told he was with me. and the representative rudely said he's not in the list. Expect this everything was good. The hotel is",2

My best friend had her kids bday at le Meridien last week and everything was very well organized. Food was very good too!! Apeksha from sales was however very helpful.she went out of the way even on off day and constantly followed up with us on call and made sure our event went on smoothly.

A big thankyou to her and her entire team that made this possible.,5
"I travel twice a year to Gurgaon for Business and stay for 2 weeks at a time. My company normally recommends the Westin or Crowne Plaza, but considering all aspects, Le Meridien is the best. I have stayed at the Westin twice and at the Le Meridien about 6 times so far. The Customer Service here is top notch, Rates are about 35% cheaper than the Westin, As a Marriott Titanium, I have always been upgraded to a Suite, their rates include Round Trip Airport Transfer and it takes only a few seconds to get get to the front door of the hotel from the airport (vs. the Westin where it takes forever to get in and get out) The only con for me is that it is 10 mins further from my Office, but all the above totally outweigh this small con. This hotel also has a very nice evening drinks and",5

I ordered something off the menu and he helped me soon with my request. It‚Äôs good service and good staff which makes a hotel successful. ,5

Will recommend to do training/meeting at this place",5
One of the most preferred hotel for us in gurgaon as a business traveller. Service was fine. I liked the club lounge though. Concierge service a little bad though otherwise everything was fine. A little far from city.,4

After what feels like forever , it worked again and brought me to the basement. The hotel staff was on the ground floor and asked if I was trapped inside the lift. And the only comments they made was ‚Äúdid I use the telecom button‚Äô. Obviously I did and it wasn‚Äôt working. It almost felt like Its my fault that I haven‚Äôt intercom them. This will be my first and last stay in this hotel. ",1

"The hotel and location are perfect. The thing that stands out is their restaurant which has fabulous team.  I remember two people Restaurant Manager Nikhil (or Nitin)  and Chef Gaurav. They were kind enough to make sure I got a custom dish prepared even in their absence. If it's Gurugram,  only stay at Le meridien.",5
"First time I‚Äôve been in this hotel back in 2015. This year came to Delhi for couple of day for business. Stayed in Le Meridian again, it was very close to the offices. Nothing has changed there: it‚Äôs still great. Staff is very polite. You get all assistance and information to any of your questions: starting from the directives how is better to get to the place you are looking for going down to what whine to select? Rooms are getting older, you can see some scratches this and there but still it has enough space and comfort. Liked that in bathroom they have big windows so in the morning you watch neighborhood area and not your sleepy and jet lagged face ))) Buffet has its variety: you can go with ready options or ask to make the dish on your own taste and selected ingredients.",5
Staff were well behaved and supportive. Mr Kamlesh and team were present for all the time for any type of assistance. Food was really nice. Thanks. Ambience were very good.All staffs are good and well behaved.,5

"Le Meridien Gurgaon has really climbed to a high level of service quality and friendliness. All staff members recognize guests and are willing to help / support in any way. I believe that for the kind of property, the overall experience is excellent and at a very good price. Food quality is also very good. Keep it up Le Meridien ! Best wishes to all of you !",5
Nice hotel and great service. Food was excellent and service is commendable.   Soft spoken and hard working staff. Mr Kamlesh and Mr Simran did a great job managing the event. They entertained every feedback and handled it with ease.   Will recommend and visit again.,5

"Wonderful hospitality,excellent food and great ambience. Add to it, highly courteous and professional staff. Thoroughly enjoyed the buffets especially large spreads during breakfasts and smiling faces. Memorable moments and stay.",5
Stayed there twice this year. The service and staff were excellent. Good quality food in the then two restaurants. The buffet and the Italian. Rooms were well kept and laundry service was excellent. The latitude bar was rather expensive but a new restaurant was opened on the top floor and prices appeared to be more reasonable. The pool area was also very good but could have done with more loungers. Over all would opt to stay there again,5
"This is real time review for this hotel as I checked in today. In order to manage a bigger wedding group, my family is being neglected and provided with a room with a pathetic view. Even having asked twice to offer a better room, no changes haven't been made thus far. Wish every customer for this hotel was same ...",3
"This hotel is excellent in terms of rooms which are bright and airy and well decorated with a beautiful view of the country park. The breakfast is delicious with lot of choice of Indian and continental food. The staff are very courteous , obliging and nothing is too much trouble . The executive lounge is well managed with excellent choice of  canap√© and alcoholic drinks. It is far from the city center but there is a metro train nearby or Uber which takes about. 45 minutes.",5
"Always smile on the faces with a high standard of service. Really good, healthy and variant food served everyday with a warm a kindly atmosphere. Many thanks to Ravi and Vandana at the frontdesk as well as the rest of the Le MERIDIEN staff ‚òÄÔ∏èü§ó",5
"Last week i was hunting for a venue for my sister's 1st anniversary bash and I went to Le Meridien gurgaon. After waiting for not more than 5 mins I was assisted by Apeksha Nawalgaria who was very pleasant to greet,she took me around the hotel and explained every part of the property in detail. She had answers to my 100s of questions and didn't loose patience once.To be honest the venue wasn't even as nice as she made it sound.. Extremely warm and equally firm as a sales person. I was one step close to confirming my event with her however unfortunately my sister decided to do her celebrations in Jaipur.I am writing this review only because I think she's worthy of the credit. In future i will consider & recommend Le Meridien if need be.",5
"One of the best memorable days spend in the Le Meridian. We were a group of 4 friends and all of our are super happy with our stay. Everything is at its best.... the room service, the food....5 star. Will definately going to stay here again.",5
"We held our son‚Äôs Wedding Reception at Le Meridien, Gurugram. It was a social gathering, in that sense. The Phoenix banquet hall was an excellent venue and accommodated our 300 guests comfortably. The arrangements done by the hotel Was superb and appreciated by one and all. The best part was the dinner menu. The food was delicious and we kept receiving messages from the friends who kept on praising the delicacies served, specially the mutton dish and the baked custard, which was unique. Everyone wanted to know the name of the Chef and he was Chef Ram. He had prepared such mouthwatering dishes that everyone was left licking their fingers. We are still receiving praises for the food even a week after the event, all thanks to Chef Ram. One more Statement by guests was that they",5
The location is a bit tricky if you are not following the GPS...check-in was not smooth ... Rooms were small..and negative feedbacks end here.. The Bose speaker in the room left us surprised...Food was as expected to be really good..world class Hospitality .. service was truly remarkable..would definitely love to come back..,4
"Very clean and tidy hotel. Looks almost new.  The staff is very courteous and hospitable.  The buffet breakfast is an amazing spread of dishes. Good location, very close to the commercial precinct in Gurgaon.",5
"This was my third stay in this hotel and this one after a gap of around 10 months. Previously had very good experience but This time, Had booking in the hotel for 8 days but shifted to other place because of highly unprofessional behavior of the reception and sales staff after only 02 days of stay. Dealing of reception staff specially of duty manager Ms Disha was very arrogant, un-courtious, rude and unacceptably poor. Unlike hospitality sector norms, They were very rigid while dealing with the guest. Because of these unprofessional behavior, I decided to shift to other hotel where everything was just opposite and as per expectations.   Will not recommend for stay as there are many better options available in near by area.",1
"I've stayed at Le Meridien Gurgaon multiple times on business and have been very impressed with the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff...Rahul, Sucheta, Rohit and Ritika to make just a few. The property is very convenient to the Cyber Hub and tech company locations in Gurgaon.",5

Total Evaluation ==>  Excellent!",5
"I had a great time staying at the hotel. The service was excellent and the staff are courteous and always smiling. The breakfast that came with the room charge was really good and you will be spoil for choice in terms of variety of food. The only incident we had was the disappointment in the vegetarian fried rice and noodle in Chinese style. There was no vegetables, gave our feedback to the chef, whom promptly apologized and offered to cook another set for us. :) Great service recovery!  The gym was clean and the equipment was well maintained. The personal trainer on duty was attentive and he even helped me to adjusted the sitting height of an equipment when I got it wrong.   Overall: highly recommended and thumbs up for all the staff within the hotel!",5
"The team at Le Meridien were extremely attentive. From the start they were welcoming, always greeted me with a smile and were always willing to help make my stay as enjoyable as possible.

Special thanks to Ritika and Vandana from guest services who brought it all together.",5

Well done and I look forward to many more visits to this beautiful hotel!",5
Have stayed many times at this hotel. One of three I've stayed at in 2018/19. Great rooms and good buffet meals. Italian restaurant is a wonderful change from the usual Indian/oriental/western buffet.,5
"Stayed with the hotel for a weekend and experienced some wonderful hospitality. The senses spa here is operational till 2 am at night and the food at Latest Recipe restaurant is a lavish spread by chef Amit. Must try the beer and barbeque, street food promotions every saturday and the sunday brunch with over 200 dishes. I stayed at the executive suite on the 11th floor, brilliant view from the window.",5
"Came into the restaurant tired having arrived from Kolkata, and decided to have dinner in the ‚Äòlatest recipe‚Äô  restaurant. Live band was on with great music playing, singers were fantastic.   But most of all, the service offered by the staff ( Sunil and Tamway) were excellent, very attentive and  balanced with a sense of humor.  I very much enjoyed the evening, thanks to both Sunil and Tamway.  I would definitely dine here again and also choose the hotel for this reason also",5

"This is my first time to travel in India. We have spent a good time in Le Meridien Gurgaon. Besides business meeting in the hotel, I sent email to arrange for personal touring on Taj Mahal for 16 people. Thanks so much to Anju Tyagi, he is Chef Concierge.  He helped me a lot for pre-preparation and confirmation. Everything had been arranged pretty well. I will choose this hotel if I travel to Gurgaon next time. If you also have touring plan and want to make well arrangement in advance, you can kindly send email to concierge, 4212 <04212.concierge@lemeridien.com>. I'm sure Anju and his team are willing to support you.",5

"Breakfast service today I. e. 5th May 2019 was impressive in general but particular reference deserves to be made of Vishwajeet who took exceptional care by his personalized attention and courtesy. Since talent needs to be recognized, we feel that he deserves encouragement by way of promotion/job raise.",5
"I visited India for business for the 1st time in April 2019. The staff was amazing; in particular, Ritika, Dipika, Amar and Pooja, who were always available to lend a hand and always went above and beyond. Thank you.",4
My stay was really good but it could have been better if i would have not been misguided by Jyoti while i asked her the way to looby she made me go to some other way while on my way i was assure that this is not the guest area but anyway continued going and mistakenly  entered the  garbage room. I would say she did it intentionally and definitely i would never like to visit a hotel where associates misguide guests... Thanks to rahul for making my stay very comfortable.,4
"Amazing hospitality! Jackpot - don't even think about searching for another hotel in this region.This is ‚ÄùLe Meridien‚Äù at it‚Äôs best! This location was very suitable for us. The entire staff was welcoming, friendly, and took great care of us.",5
Very courteous staff...excellent service.. one of the best staff I have ever seen.. amazing breakfast..very comfortable rooms..spa services also very good.. no minus points.. hotel is perfect in all segments..,5
My stay at Le Meridian was awesome.  All  thanks to Tanmay Bhat for all the help and guidance in making our stay special. Would love to visit again.  Am taking back some really great memories. Highly recommended to everybody.,5
"Awesome staff and hotel. We went for spending some luxury time there and it met our expectations. But the surroundings are not nice, under construction buildings everywhere, so that was not good. Rest hotel is awesome.",4
"It was an official awards ceremony we visited the hotel on the 9th of April. Well they call it a 5 star property, but its worth is not more then a average 4 star stay. Food Quality was pathetic, food was not even properly cooked it was hard to believe that food quality was so cheap. I haven't stayed here it was just an official visit so i cant comment on staying here, but with the quality of food here would not recommend anyone to stay here at all.",3
Definitely had a great time . Love the food and ambience ..amazing staff..will definitely recommed this hotel to my all friends...will visit soon ... Special thanks to Jaidev from latest recipe .. He is very courteous and polite ..  We had a great time !!,5
"I really enjoy staying at the Le Meridien Gurgaon, the hotel is very bright, the staff extremely friendly and the services excellent. The breakfast has immense variety and there is always something you can enjoy there.",5
"I stayed here in January 2019. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere if you like to walk to local places but not far from anywhere in Gurgaon if you want to travel by taxi. It is a new building which initially gives an impression of a budget hotel as there is not really much of a lounge area near reception or anywhere. However, the rooms are very modern and comfortable, though small.  As a platinum member, I was upgraded to a suite, which basically consists of two rooms and it was excellent.  The breakfast in the main restaurant is fantastic. The service in the club lounge was excellent, all members of staff, especially Rahul and Ritu (I hope you had an excellent honeymoon) going out of their way to help. The hotel has beautiful but small garden. The swimming pool is",5
"Very good visit, particular thanks to chef Subaram and restaurant host Mohit who catered to my every food need and more.  Room spotless and spacious. Some issues with electricals that were corrected immediately.",5
"My recent stay at this property was nothing less than amazing. The check in was quick. The rooms were big and clean. It has an amazing location- near to Cyber Hub, Ambience Mall, Metro Station. The staff was quite friendly. Special thanks to Mr. Rahul and his team for making the stay perfect.",5
Nothing around here on foot But everything is ready at this hotel!!  Enjoyed staying 2nights there. Good reception with nice greetings.  Facility in the room is also nice.keep cleaned. So many Tv channels.  Good breakfast . Totally I love this hotel.,5
"Stayed here for a few days during my business travel. It is located on MG Road close to the Guru Dronacharya and Sikandarpur Metro stations, both are approx. 1 kilometer away which makes it convenient to move around if you want to avoid traffic snarls.It is 15 mins drive to cyber hub which is, sort of, center of the city.   The rooms are spacious and neatly done. The staff, as expected from all premium hotels, is courteous and friendly.  I had breakfast a coupe of times in the ground floor restaurant, whose name I have forgotten. The spread was elaborate with options across multiple cuisines.",4
"The club room at 11th floor is perfect for holding meetings, and sessions both with external and internal teams. Have been using it for the last two trips and will certainly use again. Vaibhav, Mangaldeep, Ajay, Rahul, and Ritu are all pros and know what they are doing.",5
"I have visited this place with one of my colleague and have stayed in room  The hotel is spik and span and offers the modern and stylist approach   Positives vibes in the hotel along with efficient and energetic staff  Have tried food at latest recipe and loved the overall ambience and food of the place   The buffet is great along with superb service,  also the area is buzzing everything you go there   In the heart of the city and offers everything on plate what you would think and wish of   Team is on toes to help you everyone you would look for, overall great experience and place   Must visit and stay once ",5
"The Reception staff is polite and prompt. Suite is spacious, clean and surprisingly with a mini gym. Buffet breakfast was delicious, wide variety to satisfy every taste. Service was personalized and excellent. Keep it up folks!",5
"I was amazed that NO Cotton buds in the room. I asked PRINCE (housekeeper guy) why ansd the guy gave me first 2 and then he told they put it only in suite room. I went down and talked to Front office Assiatance Manager M. RAHUL he came to me and he did not introduce himself it is so rude from him!!!. Although I told him I want to talk to the Duty manager who was attending another request, he wanted to handle my request.He herad my complain and started blaming the housekeeping. Despite the fact that NO housekeeping associate will act from his own without any instruction. When I told him that I am a platinum member his attitude changed because he realized that he cannot tell me ""non sense stories""  I did not byuy the PLatinum card  M Rahul. I stay within Mariott more than 70/75",2
"Posting experience on behalf of Dov Kagan #1221 1st April for 4 nights. Everybody was hospitable for sure and very kind from check in to check out. Shout out to Jaidev from restaurant  for very intuitive and prompt service. Dinner and Lunch experience at Latest recipe went well with great team of servers. Team at lounge Vaibhav carries is great hospitality personality with long pisitive career ahead he was amazing, doesn't think twice for any job how much ever small the task is. Rahul promptly helped with organizing keyboard and mouse when most needed which saved lot of time. Nitin was very warm as well and the Chef at lounge for BF.

"I highly recommend this hotel to all kind of travelers. Rooms are not that big but you have everything that you need. Housekeeping is one of the best.

I have stayed at Le Meridien Gugraon for more than 30 nights during my business trip to India.   About room and hotel : The hotel is located at the MG road which makes everything accessible within 15-20 mins. There are multiple restaurants inside the hotel itself. The breakfast buffet has a huge spread even than many Indian weddings. The gym is nice with a trainer available. The lounge is amazing and you have quite a good number of options. The staff will make additional options available if you need something. The rooms are latest and upgraded. Just the size is a bit small especially if you are staying for 30 days. One more small point about the room is that it has very less number of power slots. Its either on study table or only on one side of the bed.   About staff: The,5
"The Hotel in general is a very nice hotel, it has 2 good restaurants a nice bar a small club lounge and good rooms however it is a long way out of the city and pretty boring on the weekends so you have to travel either into Delhi City or Cyber City (Which is not so good at the weekend). There was also a bad smell around the hotel so sitting by the pool was not very pleasant not something the Hotel can do much about but the local drainage caused some unpleasant smells",3
"Hello! My first time arrival to India 25 March and stayed at Le Meridien for the first week as I also went to Jaipur,Pink City on the weekend! I am very satisfied with the services given by the Hotel Staff, the manager, Mr. Rahul (if not mistaken) and the Front team, Ms. Vandana (if not mistaken) was very helpful and accommodating especially to support me as a mother to keep my breastmilk safe in their deep freezer as it needs special treatment!  I‚Äôm back from Jaipur and they give me much more better Room and even access to Club Lounge for my stay until 13th of April! Thanks a lot....",5
"Hello, I am very satisfied with my stay at Meridien Gurgaon. The level of service is received was on the level I never experienced before (and I am an active world traveler).  I had a chance to take a trip to Taj Mahal organized by your hotel. I don't remember the name of the driver however I was very impressed with his driving skills making the long trip very pleasant. Quality of food in the hotel restaurant is outstanding. Your hotel staff was always helpful and very professional concentrated on solving problems and assuring pleasant stay. We were also invited to the party that organized for us that was unforgettable experience. Your hotel executives made our stay is unforgettable. Overall experience ACHCHHA HAI!",5
"a suitable place to stay at Gurgaon very quiet, all the team is smiley faces, the lobby is very nice at the time of my stay was Holi festival so I already celebrate with the team by the fantastic way,",5
"I stayed at Le Meridien for two weeks in late December 2018 / early January 2019.  The entire staff was very accommodating and made me feel like I was at home, especially the team in the executive lounge.  The team made a genuine effort to recognize me, learn my food/drink preferences, and get to know me.  I also appreciated their willingness to discuss local culture and customs with me, which I found very educational and further exemplified their friendliness. Other services I enjoyed include: spa, restaurants/room service, car service (to/from airport, my local office and various tourist destinations), and laundry.  I thoroughly enjoyed my visit at Le Meridien, and it would be my first choice of hotel if I have the opportunity to visit Gurgaon again!",5

Had a session for 5 day's in the hotel..it seems they are under staffed...need improvement on specific customers requirements.though a few staff understand it.they are more process oriented than anything else.,4
"I was in Gurgaon for a week on business.  Our team stayed at Le Meridien.  I found it to be quite nice with wonderful hospitality.  The rooms were spacious and the bed comfortable.  Bathroom was spacious and well equipped.  I found the hospitality outstanding and the staff could not do enough for you, especially in the restaurant.  I highly recommend this property if it is close to where you need to be.  Although this is a luxury hotel, by American standards the price could be considered mid range, but pricing is relative to your location of reference",5
"I generally stay at the Taj and Westin but decided to try Le Meridien and was unhappy with my decision, though I was booked in a executive room when I entered the room it was smaller than a standard room of any 5 star that I have ever stayed in, the washroom was small as well with poor quality and insufficient towels, the check in was also not smooth as well,  I am a Marriott Gold Elite member and inspite of my room and taxes being paid Jayam insisted on taking a pre authorization of Rs 3000 inspite of me not agreeing to the same, he told me that the amount will not be charged but the SMS I got from my bank showed a transaction of the same amount, no other Hotel of Marriott takes a pre authorization so extremely unwanted step there. The AC in the room was not working and inspite",3
"Visited this hotel couple of days back and was impressed with the hospitality. Special thanks to the Chef for creating a Chinese dish, which wasn't part of their regular menu. Ambience is good, rooms are nice and overall excellent experience",4
I had booked the hotel as am marriott rewards guest  I booked the car for pick up from New Delhi Station as was coming by Amritsar Shatabdi for 11 pm but car didn't come as they claimed they have not received request  I somehow booked meru cab after 45 mins of waiting as Ola n Uber was not available   I called the hotel requested for in room check in as was very tired   I reached the hotel around 12:40 am was shocked that was kept standing at front office for 10 mins with a blank form given to sign without any details   I have seen  this for the first time in marriott as am very regular guest of Marriott stay close to 20 days in a month in Marriott hotels only   I was asked for a preauthorisation stating it's a policy which I duly know n understand only requested Front Office,1
"The team at the Meridien went completely above and beyond. I was in touch with them frequently as my inbound trip was very disrupted because of flight issues. Two things stood out:  1. I was missing a camera battery I needed for my safari in India and did not discover it until a few hours before my flight from the U.S. I sent a message to the concierge team, thinking it was a long shot that they would be able to locate it. Not only did they find it, they purchased it for me with an incredible short turn around so that I could pick it up when I arrived. AMAZING service.  2. Because our flights were so messed up, we missed our first night's stay and were not going to be back at the Meridien until after a few days on Safari. The team then brought the battery to me at the airport",5
"We chose le meridien ggn for our 3rd anniversary celebration and it exceeded all our expectations.All staff specially Rahul was very supportive at each step and took care of all our requests.He ensured complimentary cake,bouquet,bed decoration,lucky dip,late check out and lounge access for us.They also treated our little boy atharv also very well and gave him a teddy bear as well.Atharv enjoyed the stay very well and played alot in the lobby.Staff at buffet breakfast was also very supportive and gave us special attention.Buffet breakfast was also well spread out with many options.Additionally,vandana at check out was also very supportive.",5
"Stayed last month for a business trip. Like most Indian hotels, since the staff is note exposed to global norms of hospitality, hygiene and amenities - they operate in a self illusion mode, feeling they are doing it right and apt. Overall comfortable stay. Hygiene issues with servers at breakfast, you will always find stains in washrooms and hair which are not yours. Management was helpful enough to find me physiotherapist on demand. Facilities like steam/ sauna which are basic for a $20/month chain gym are treated as too precious and one has to pre inform everytime you intend to use the same. Special call out for my Chauffer Yadavji, who took good personal care of me between my meetings, was very kind, knowledgeable and inspired confidence with his driving.",3

"I spent one week at Le Meridien Gurgaon. Very nice hotel with excellent client service.  Staffs at the restaurant (those working during the day, night shift) were welcoming, always greeting with a smile, and customer service at top level. Ranjeet Verma was one of them.",5
This trip started with great kindness. Vijinder who arranges our car transport met us at the arrival gate since we were late getting off the flight. He saw our daughter limping from an accident and found airport staff and got a wheelchair right away even when they weren‚Äôt happy about it. He brought us all the way to the car park himself to make sure we were alright.  Any hotel gives you a room; if you want to be treated at this level book here. ,5
"I spent two nights in this property. The service is very good. As Marriott Bonvoy Titanium member, received a suite upgrade which is appreciated. The club lounge is very good and almost all staff there gave excellent service. Ms. Ritika from guest relationship made all practical arrangements perfectly, which is highly appreciated. The breakfast can be improved, but managed to get the required service.",5
"Great location, away from Concrete Jungle. Great Service. I stayed for 10 days and always felt welcome. The front desk Staff was great. Ravi at the front desk was extremely helpful. In the kitchen, Chef Rajesh, Chef from Madurai and Sardar Ji (apology - for forgetting his name) were very friendly, attentive to our needs and met the needs promptly and with a smile. In the lounge, we got perhaps the best experience within the hotel. We spend a good amount of time in the lounge, mainly due to sickness, but always felt welcome. Of special mention is the service received from Raj Kumar (From Banaras - Hope I got his name correct and apologize if I did not).",5
"They have lovely room with all modern amenities provided plus you can always ASK for which room you prefer as they have a variety of options.  Due to work schedule could not used their pool or spa however heard great feedback when was at their Lounge late evening from other resident guests.  Location wise it is right at the center and hence commuting time to office was below 30 mins even at peak time Plus the weather was awesone with light drizzle in the morning , Fog all around and a nip in the air. Wish I was there with family and kids !!!",5
Conveniently located; courteous staff; modern amenities. Front desk staff efficient and polite. Two good restaurants to choose from. Ordered room service and wasn't disappointed; the mutton preparation (Indian cuisine) is highly recommended.,5
"We stay in this hotel for 6 says. The club lounge was perfect,  Cosy place,nice food.  Very good service and friendly stuff, sprcialy Vaibhav and vipin and Ravi. Will stay in this hotel on my next trip again.",5
"This is my second week at the meridien, and I already feel at home. From check in to housekeeping to chefs making sure you get the feeling like you belong to their family. This staff go out of their way to ensure their guests are totally comfortable. Kudos to Mangaldeep in the club lounge, who is one of the most talented and up and coming bartenders country. Thanks also to Vaibhav, Rahul, Vandana, and Ritu for ensuring 5 star service here every day. Special thanks to chef Gaurav, Mr. Lucky and all the coffee shop staff for all the attention to detail on every breakfast meal served! And finally, great job Gourav and sales team to convince me to stay here and you were right. You have one of the best products in the Delhi Gurgaon area. I encourage more visitors to experience this",5
"At Le Meridien your are gonna feel like you never leave home, everyone and everything is in place for make your stay as better as you want. A member of the front desk gives you welcome as soon as you open the door of the transportation delivery by the hotel from airport. After that everything gets better, check in process is quite simple because they prepare everything in advance. In less than half an hour you will be enjoy your room, which I recommend select one with windows on the bathroom and on the higher floor. A desk, couch, TV, audio, mood light, art, the most comfortable bed, a wardrobe with a safe, full carpet on the floor and impressive view is what you are gonna see in every room. An envelope will wait for you with all the option regarding trips and things to do in",5
"This hotel is 5-star by way of its staff, services, restaurants and facilities, however, I had a couple of glitches in my room that stop me from giving it 5-stars as a review. The bed and linens were insanely comfortable. I slept like a baby. The beds are modern and low which was great for me as I was traveling with my preschooler. My room could generally use a coat of paint on the baseboards and smelled musty when I arrived. After showering with the bathroom door open, I figured this is why it smelled musty as the steam filled the room. Our bathtub water when filled was a yellow tint. We all know to avoid the water in india, but as a 5-star hotel, it would be nice if there was a better filter on the water for bathing. That said, the shower was amazing and the room allowed for a",4
"Terrible rooms! So small! You can barely move around! Not my expectation of a Metidien hotel! What makes my experience worse is that when checked-in at front desk, I was wrongfully told that Being a Pratinum Elite Level with Marriott Rewards, I was upgraded , while in reality I was given the worse room on one of the club floors that in any case I was entitled to due to my status! All I ask for is a decent room so do not lie to me about an upgrade that is in reality a ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù Never to come back to this hotel again!",2
"If you are looking for an excellent hotel in Gurgaon with an outstanding services and facilities, this is the place to be. A special thanks to the front Office Manager - Mr Nitesh Kapur, Ms Rikita (front desk) and Mr Mangaldeep at the club lounge who are making my stay here in Delhi so pleasant. Many thanks, this will be the first of many visits to this hotel. Regards Juliano Da Cruz",5
"I stayed in October, on what must be my about my 4th visit here for work. The hotel is lovely, and the staff are fabulous. It feels like they are all your very good friends for the duration of the trip! I used the meeting facilities for our client meetings, which were organised to an excellent standard. The club lounge is a great bonus with wonderful food and drinks in the evening. The concierge staff are fabulous and provide a great private car service. I am looking forward to my next stay here.",5
"A great hotel with excellent amenities. The staff are superb and the Executive Club on the 11th floor is a peaceful setting serving breakfast, snacks in the evening and a quite place to work if you wish overlooking the city. Would like to thank the staff and in particular Vikash (the chef for the executive lounge) and Jauhar responsible for the lounge for making my stay so welcoming.",5
"Very helpful staff - always looking to take care of you and accommodating to your requests. Food is excellent, great breakfast buffet and very nice selections in the club lounge. Not too much around the immediate area, though.",5
The place is nicely located beautiful to look at the service is excellent and the behaviour of employees is commendable right from the valet parking to the place where we had tea coffee food was excellent the product as such was nicely crafted and they were really many Special dishes which were available for our guests love the place a good place for foreigners families couples everyone attaching few photographs of yesterday's function.,5
Really nice and quiet environment. Very attentive staff! Hot and good breakfast meals. Remember to offer the eggs cooked by Chef vikash. Very fresh and good; the chef takes time to meet and to ask for your opinions!,5
"I stayed at this hotel for a night as my last night in Delhi. I got upgraded to well appointed suite room which was very spacious and has a great view. During my stay, my friend got fever and all staff especially at Club Lounge are very helpful. They brought us heater and Indian's herbal drink to get us warm.   The dinner at club lounge was really good. They had more choices from vegan or non-vegan. The staff are responsive to help you.   Also, special thanks to Reetu, Rahul for helping us.",5
i have stayed at this property several times since the days it was pullman. areas of improvement:  1. Consistent with every check in since my first stay was they are never able to find or map me to my previous stays including starwood membership. Blame is system down?! 2. plumber should check flow of sink pipe water to ensure water done not spill to make it messy. Go check out the rooms sink tap to understand my comment. 3. if your command over english language is not good please use hindi with an Indian. suggestion to certain staff or go and enroll for an improved course or just read 2 articles of your favorite english daily loudly!,3
"It's always a very comfortable and relaxing stay with le Meridien Gurgaon. Whenever I visit Gurgaon specially I stay in this hotel.  Even I suggest to my friends for stay there coz the staff courtineous and hospitality and I would like to mention few names from reception like Ms. Kannu, Kajal, Pooja and Mr Anuj for their warm welcome and a kind attitude who always ready to help which feels like home away home and also I .  Also I am always impressed with lucky in restaurant and chef Gaurav Singh their hard work and swift service. Kudos to the team.",5
"Stayed three nights Jan 2019. Good property. Have not stayed at other Marriott/Starwood properties in Gurgaon so cannot compare but was at JW Aerocity a few years ago. The JW is much nicer but newer and larger so not surprising.  Was upgraded to a suite on the Club Floor - had a Club level King room booked so this was a ‚Äúreal‚Äù upgrade. Small for a suite; I‚Äôd rather have the space without a wall in the middle. Somewhat dated furniture, all clean just a bit tired. They gave me a smoking room whereas my profile is for nonsmoking. No obvious smell of smoke (other than typical acrid smell that permeates Delhi in the winter)  club is great - extensive spread for breakfast and in the evening. Chef-prepared hot dishes to order. Space is cramped but wasn‚Äôt crowded when I was there. Would",4
"Greeeted in reception and shown to my room by a lovely member of staff who talked me through the features of the room. On trying the shower, I found it flooded the entire bathroom, and the water from the sink tap initially came out brown. There were water stains on the walls of the bathroom and a constant sound of running water from behind the bathroom wall. Bed and pillows were comfortable but the aircon was difficult to get to not be constantly freezing cold. Colleagues on higher floors had much nicer rooms, so I was very disappointed that all rooms weren‚Äôt to the same standard.",3
"Clean rooms, good ambience and excellent food. For a business or an official meeting, the conference hall is well equipped with a reasonably spacious dining and snack area. The hotel is well connected and quite accessible for rental cabs",4
"This is a relatively new property in Gurugram close to New Delhi. The interiors are just average. But, all that is inconvenient in use and bit unsafe in the bathroom, it is compensated by the manners and services rendered by the crew.",3
"My special thanks goes out to the special individuals in the following department/s;  1. Lounge - Reetu, Rahul, Mangaldeep 2. Front Office/Reception Desk - Rahul Mahindroo, Vandana Kanojia, Kanu, Sahiban 3. Restaurant - Rajesh Rai, Samaresh Das  And many more who I do not remember by their individual name/s, including a tall guy at the room cleaning services, he is very humble and prompt.  My strongest recommendation and suggestion to the Le Meridien Gurgaon management team is to have more such professionals who understands the meaning of guest services and guest relations with great orientation.  Each of these guys make me feel welcome to the hotel every time I walk in to the Le Meridien Gurgaon.",3
I have been at this hotel almost 10 months away from my home but it is really refreshing to stay at this hotel.  Every staff member makes a honest effort to make your day and overall stay memorable.  The food is excellent and new chefs in hotel have introduced some good new fusion recipes as well.,5
"My stay in Le Meridien Gurgaon was great because of their hospitality, professionalism, great food and service quality. I stayed their with my elderly mother and suddenly she had to run to the hospital because of her previous illness. All of the hotel staff came to my help and support in every  possible way.  Many thanks to the duty manager Kanu along with Sucheta and Ritika for their help. Mrs. Preeti Vats",5
"I really appreciate your kind hospitality and the high level of professionalism in hotels' industry.  Rooms are clean, food is fantastic, room service is on time with the quality requested. I'm very thankful for those lovely days. Thanks for everyone. Dr. Sherif Taha ",5
"Anuj you are a real asset to Marriott brand, you excel in both the services you and your team deliver as well as the level of hospitality you grant to your guests around the clock, you really make my visits to Delhi so unique and joyful   Sucheta knows how to make people feel home with a genuine smile that greets you from the minute you set a foot in the hotel",5
"All superlatives to this hotel, breakfast is great, gym and sauna are super. All the stuff at hotel are very kind and catered quickly to all of my requests.  For breakfast there is the best offer I have ever seen, many great dishes, for one month there I ate every day different food. In gym I had great workouts, coach Prerna helped me choose what is right for me, as I am beginner in that sport and I am very thankful to her. Hotel is also at convenient location, 7 minutes walk from Guru Drona station where you can jump on yellow line to Delhi.",5
I stayed here for 3 weeks and the staff are fabulous. When I left I had forgotten my cell phone in the taxi on the way to the airport. The taxi driver brought it back to the hotel and I was still able to get it back about 3 weeks later. It helps that I had a tracker on the phone so I could see it was a the hotel. They went the extra mile for me to package the phone and ship it.,5
"Room was comfortable, very attentive and flexible staff, delicious breakfast buffet! The personalized service was kind and extremely helpful. Spa was relaxing and the interior was bright and airy, pleasant to be in.",5
"The Hotel is set in a good location - close to the city and yet away from the hustle and bustle as it is off the main street and overlooks a supposedly ""green belt"". The rooms are decent sized and well maintained. The breakfast and the accompanying restaurants are good - and there is a made to order menu for breakfast as well. Staff are friendly and helpfull with the local directions etc. The only negative is the sound coming from outside - even though the Hotel is soundproofed. But I guess that is what one would expect in Indian cities :-)",4
"Visited this hotel twice now. Staff treated me as a VIP. Personal contact, Vandana, was an absolute Angel. Always knew my name. Bartender Ashish always had my drink ready. Breakfast staff remembered my room number from day one. For such a big hotel it's very personal. Being driven around by a uniformed diver felt a bit decadent but was very welcome. If I need to get back here I won't doubt to visit here again.  Room was very comfortable. ",5
"A wall of colourful stunning flowers and stunning sculptures greet you. The thought that the hotel management puts into making the lobby a relaxed and comfortable place to wait and read (lighting is so important) is greatly appreciated. They even provide books (John Grisham's novel) for you to pass the time and they will happily charge your mobile phone if needed. The room is comfortable (520) and compact. The only drawback is the shower which wets the floor because there is not divider. Food and service are excellent in the coffee house and overall, staff a extremely observant, friendly and helpful. Highly recommended for a short stay (20 - 30 mins from the airport)",5
Nice excellent luxurious.10 o 10.very well maintained hotel.room r well maintained n shiny interior.food quality served at breakfast excellente.world dining best at this place.for economy best if booked with MAP plans or CP plans.,5
"Le Meridien Gurgaon is a great, comfortable hotel, situated about 20 minutes from IGI Airport. While the hotel itself is great, what truly separates it is the truly warm, personal service from all of its staff, especially the Marriott member relations leader, Vandana. She‚Äôs truly special.",5
i checked in on 5th jan in le meridian gurgaon NCR along with a friend  The reason of staying in le meridian was it‚Äôs proximity to  guest house in sector 26 Where my expat friend was staying  I had heard lot of negative feedback about this hotel but never thought to experience it myself  I never had such a bitter and horrible experience in my life  which I want to share at this forum  It was around 2 pm when we moved into hotel we brought our own car we had to wait for 3-4 mins before a guy came to ask us whether we are staying here no body was there to take out our luggage usually it happens in less than half a minute  The lady on reception was sad tired and unwelcoming her facial expression was disappointing as if we came as a burden on her  There were no welcome drinks ,1
"Everything abt my stay was superb, thanks to the wonderful staff, specially Ms. Vandana, who's hospitality had been very warm n welcoming. Food was also very good, during all the meals, be it bfast, lunch or dinner. Location of the hotel was also ok, not far from vasant kunj and saket malls. So, overall, a very good hotel!",5
This hotel is nothing short of brilliant. And I'd say that this is much to do with the staff. My suite was clean tidy as one would expect. Everything was wired into my bed side console. Sure there were snags and I could not pick away. But the price for the value of the stay need be taken into account. And that is where I am won over. With the exception of one other hotel in Agra. This hotel nails it with service. It was so good I stayed there on my way out of India 7weeks later.   Super convenient. The air conditioned metro is 15 minutes walk and can get you anywhere in Delhi within 40 minutes. The roads and traffic are just too much. The metro is pretty empty.,5
"The hotel location is very good close to the office.  Transport, laundry, and other room services are very good. Food is excellent with so many varieties :) Staff are courteous with a genuine smile on the face :)",4
The staff was very accommodating and treated us with wonderful service.  Or accommodations were excellent and all the amenities were great.  The restaurant staff worked diligently to provide us with local delicacies.  Highly recommend this location!,5
"A big thank you for making our stay so remarkable.  It would have not been worth for until and unless the service provided by Ms. Vandana, Mr Rahul at the executive lounge and Mr Sanjay from the house keeping department made its mark to treat us the best.  The shindig that we had during our stay for the purpose turned out to be astonishing.  Thank you for displaying such expression",5
"Room was decorated very nicely for comfortable stay. Team of hotel were very friendly. Specially, at front Desk, Ms. Vandana was very cooperative during my check out. Best facilitation by Vandana at front desk.",5
"Everything about this place is perfect. Their food ,ambience is fantastic.Their manager Mr himanshu Bisht and servers are very helpful and courteous and so they make us come back again and again.Specially thanks to Mr Bisht... ",5
"The staf is awesome and i have visited all two restaurant. Though i like both the restaurant but the Italian restaurant i found the best. Staff is really helpful,gentle and always smile on their face. I dont remember the name but the guy who clean my room everyday is really nice and well behaviour. Vandana's smile is really nice and she always greet me with her nice smile and helped me too..",5
"This is a well maintained property in Gurgaon, slightly away from chaotic part of Gurgaon. The staff are friendly and very attentive. The food is also great with wide varieties and spread in the buffet.",4
"Nice property with good view, all staffs were very kind and helpful. The presidential suite is really nice and well kept. Lounge staff Harish was very helpful, went extra mile to get the food from the main kitchen. Impeccable clean rooms and bathrooms. Food was good hope they coffee pods in the mini bar.",5
We had a conference at the hotel and stay was comfortable with good rooms and breakfast. The food was also good. The breakfast was served at two locations and there was better variety in the ground floor restaurant. The check in time of 2 pm is a little inconvenient for travellers. ,4
"My second stay at this hotel. The overall experience was fine, however I felt they have very limited option for veg food in the menu. The taste of the food is really nice but they can certainly add more options. Rooms and beds are comfortable and the overall service is also good. The only other drawback is the location, the market/malls are not in walking distance and you need to hire a cab. The response time from front desk was not quick at times, but nothing alarming.",4
"This is a nice ""crisp"" hotel. It definitely fits the Le M√©ridien profile and has all that you would expect. Comfortable rooms. Good service. Tasty F&B.  As with most upscale India hotels there is a sense that they try a bit too hard but can't fault them for that. You do get the sense that staff are hovering over you though.  Only two areas that almost dropped it to 4 stars. First by the guest evelators there's a gift shop. Stuff looked nice but the owner is a bit too aggressive and slightly creeped me out. You expect to escape that experience when you walk into the hotel walls. Second my king bed was a bit lumpy. Okay sleep but I suspect the beds could use a replacement.  A couple standouts. The Italian restaurant had a great Sunday brunch spread. Lounge happy hour has decent",5
I am currently staying in this property and i realpy like the hospitality of the staff they are very friendly and professional  specially miss. Vandana. Who always helps me and guide me too. I have stayed to this property twice and this is my third visit and i would realpy like to come here again well depends on my company but yes i would definitely come for my personal visit. Also i would like to highlight the executive lounge which is worth paying.. specially i really enjoyed the happy hours,5
"One of the worst planned electrical layout in any room. One can have only 4 modes master on, Day, mood and night mode. There is no way you can switch on the TV with lights off. You have to on the day mode (all bright lights on) or master on to on the TV.   Mattresses seems to have lived their life. They sink in.",2
"@lemeridien  ‚Äî I dined at LeMeridien Gurgaon on 30th November. Gave my new Toyota Fortuner at the valet only to get it retuned with a massive scratch right below the fuel tank. The staff seemed indifferent and on my demand to see cc tv footage, all I was shown were 3 unclear clippings of my car entering the hotel, being parked in a dark basement, and exiting the basement; clippings no more than 20 seconds while I stayed in the hotel for over 2 hours.   Very dissatisfied with your lack of footage, I was told by the management that they will reach out to the valet service and provide me an update. This was on Monday 3 dec. it is now 7 dec and I‚Äôm still waiting for an update. ",1
 Food was very good. Meet chef Rohan he was good knowledge of Indian cuisine and the food served by him was really excellent. I want to share my good experience & time i spend there with my friends. Please go and have a food by chef Rohan,5
"Friendly and accomodating staff who couldnt do enough you help , well appointed rooms and facilities. Good gym and nice choice of different dining. Stayed for 10 days on business and would return again. ",5
The hotel has great locational advantage if you have meetings at Gurgaon. There are decent eating and bar options but the main dampener for me was the room size and slow service. There is one centralized number for every request and it was difficult to get hold of any person on that number. Whilst the front office staff tries making a good first impression of the property but ultimately the room size and service quality gets this hotel down in my reviews.,3
"Stay was very comfortable with all required amenities available.  Rooms are very neat and classy, Nothing to be talked on negative side .. Breakfast is yummy and spread is huge .  Recommend this hotel if you want to stay in Gurgaon.  ",5
"Plush rooms and great service.  The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. In particular, a big shout-out to Chef Aniket and Chef Ramji who made my stay even more comfortable with their homely cooking.  Conveniently located, close to Cyber City. ",4
"My destination of choice when doing business in Gurgaon. Friendly and efficient staff.Transfer from/to the airport can easily be organised. Excellent Buffets for breakfast and dinner (never tried lunch). Rooms clean; complimentary coffee and water available. After a few stays there, I was upgraded to the Club level, allowing free access to a private lounge on the top of the hotel wher plenty of complimentary food and drinks are available.",5
"We made a booking at the ‚Äúlatest recipe‚Äù for my husband‚Äôs birthday dinner. While booking the table we mentioned about birthday and we were told that they would provide a table decoration of flowers and candle, and also a special dessert/table.  On arrival, we were escorted to a table which was quite ordinary and same as the others. On asking about my request, I have been told they are looking into it. But no one got back and it had been very disappointing as you don‚Äôt expect this from a large hotel chain like Le Meridien. I have come here before multiple times for birthdays/occasions and never been treated so badly.  On the spread of the dinner buffet, it was quite sumptuous and tasty. However, half way through our dinner, we were discussing -‚Äúwhat happened to their service",3
"Not that i stayed at many hotels in India, but this is my top 5 hotels in India. The hotel was very clean, the staff very efficient and it had a very nice ambience. For business or leisure, this is definitely one of the best value for money in Gurgaon",4
"Conveniently located on a quiet road and uncrowded surroundings,yet with easy access to most of Gurugram and neighbouring Delhi . Functional rooms that are comfortable but not very large . Just one speciality restaurant - Italian which is elegant and offers good food. The multi cuisine coffee shop is decent but the staff need some training in the basics such as laying a complete table set ,or lowering their own conversation !  However everyone is really courteous and eager  to please ,and that does make for a warm and pleasant experience .",4
"This was my fourth time I visited this hotel. As usual, I enjoyed the stay. People who work here are always so helpful. There are so many names that I could mention..Mr. Rahul and his team at the reception, guys from the kitchen- Mr. Roy, Mr. Lucky, Mr. Gaurav, then perfect cleaning in the rooms provided by Mr. Rajkumar, helpful guys at the gym and many other people who make each stay exceptional.",5
I had a requirement for some 40 hampers for festive season through the hotel. Had organized through the hotel. I was offered amazing deals with amazing hampers. The team here had been amazing throughout. They got the order ready for us in less than 24 hours. The entire process was seamless and the team took personal attention to ensure everything was perfect. Would like to thank Gaurav Pathak & Vikram Kapoor for their assistance throughout.  They and their team ensure their guests leave happily.  Thank You team LMG :-),5
"Nothing wrong with the hotel at all, except that it would not make much difference if they replaced their entire staff with emotionless robots. Dont expect any hospitality here but basic minimum standards.",3
"Spent 5 days at this hotel very nice. Staff very friendly. Room very clean. Food in restaurants also very good. Abuj the chief Concierge and team organised a trip to Taj Mahal, that's was great with surprise picture take of my Wife and me üòÑ",5
"Great staff. Frendily and helpful. Pretty guest relations executive. Vandana. Great food but they have no beef and no pork. A few rooms have a problem with mould and mildew, due to the construction, they use clay bricks in India. It absorbs moisture. Also, Very overpriced alcohol at bar.",4
"Fantastic hotel.  Stayed in one of the Executive Suites on the 11th floor for two weeks whilst on a business trip.   Room has good features, very comfortable bed, two bathrooms, lounge area with very large windows.  Great positive is that you can watch all of the Premier League football matches which kickoff at 3pm on Saturdays!!   Some of the sockets in the room can fit all types of plugs, I brought an adaptor but it isn‚Äôt necessary as UK plus just go straight in.  Laundry is good as well, only 500 rupees on Thursday and Friday for 5 items.   Hotel is very welcoming with great staff. I have to give a mention to the people in the Club Lounge on the 11th floor! Hospitality, service and food was very good. I recommend upgrading, particularly if you‚Äôre on business.   Gym is decent.",5
"Homely atmosphere in a hotel is but a rare thing. For those like me who travel a lot, hotels are virtually our second home. Such an experience was given to me by the courteous staff of Le Meridien Gurgaon.  With sincere thanks to the following staff who made my stay a very pleasant one: Housekeeping: Manager Mr Nitin, staff Mr Roshan and Mr Dev Chefs who made excellent South Indian and Chinese fare Restaurant manager Mr Nikhil and his team including Mr Sunil and Ms Mamta Those unseen faces of room service who always understood my requirements.  Duty manager Mr Anurag and his team Thank you so much. Looking forward to being there again!!",5
"My business makes me travel throughout the year and brings me to Delhi NCR once a month and have stayed in Hotels across the world and several in Delhi. After trying out several I have made my home in Delhi the Le Meridien in Gurugram over the past 2 years i have stayed here about 25 times and they have always made me feel at home the staff are pleasant and remember the regular guest preferences and the honest smile always makes a difference. needless to say that the my first time and first few face Rahul, Disha and Prince made me come back and haven‚Äôt stayed anywhere else in delhi the last 2 years",5
i have been staying in this property for almost 6 months and it feels like family. the whole staff is so dedicated in making people happy. its very close to the cyber city and yet offers quiet place to relax. could do with a nice night place which i believe they re working on. food is excellent,4
This is my second visit and I yes for sure not the last. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. I m very happy with the hospitality of the staff specially Ms.Vandana from front office.She has been very welcoming and helpful and when she is not working we miss her.. I would like to thank you all.,5
"I have very positive feedback of my stays at the Le Meridien Gurgaon. Though I have been there many time, the service and personal attention by the staff has been consistent and outstanding. This has also been quite consistent across the teams starting with but not limited to the front desk, the restaurants and the lounge, though the following have made the stay memorable - Kajal, Sucheta, Vandana, Aniban, Lucky, Chef Gaurav - to name a few. Thank you and looking forward to my next visit.",5
"Had an absolute amazing time at Le Meredith. Five star service! From the second we arrived which was at 4am, they were kind enough to give us a room to stay for a couple hours before our check in time. Breakfast was the best way to start the day! From Sunil, Lucky who took care of us every day with such kindness. When I come back to Delhi I would stay here in a. Heartbeat, especially to see the staff! The soup brought us back to life. The last day I was so in love with the soup I asked the chef how it was made and he was kind enough to give me the spices they used to make the soup. Made my day! Love this hotel. Thank you for the amazing experience! And making our trip that much better! ",5
Very happy and nice hotel. Great food and wonderful staff like GOIRAV BHATNAGAR from sales help us around the city and REETU was amesome in Lounge. They make my day like anything.   Checking has awesome the welcome drinks like a lot. Beautiful room. Great services in spa.   They have nice staff ( GOIRAV BHATNAGAR ) and nice food in the lounge. Nice pool as well we are enjoying a lot still some days left but I am gonna to put my review because I cannot wait. ,5
"I stayed in the meridian to get a weekend get away from work last month and I have to say it‚Äôs been one of the greatest experiences staying here. The hospitality is great and the food is amazing . I think for a 5 star the price is also pretty moderate . It has all great facilities like swimming , snooker,tt , gym , etc what you can expect from a 5 star .  The rooms are spacious and have. All great facilities  So if in Gurgaon I would recommend staying here.  Kudos ",5
"This was the third stay at this property in 2018 and a consistent experience. Key highlights: lounge, spa, food, amicable staff, location. Thanks to Mangaldeep in lounge, Chef Om Prakash and Chef Gaurav, Jaidev and Lucky from restaurant and Gavatri from front desk for being so considerate. Met the expectations completely!",4
"Each stay of mine leaves me wanting more. Everything is perfect...rooms, food, room service and the great ambience of the lobby. Special mention of the Health Club has to be made. It is spacious and all equipment is world class. Also Prerna, the Gym Trainer is very skilled and always ready to help with her valuable tips. Also special mention has to be made of Lucky who is a very attentive Captain in your restaurant ready to help with any special need.",5
We had a work event here - support staff helped us in every aspect . Great welcome and smile from Vandana at the front desk. I will definitely come back to stay.Thank you for making my stay comfortable.,5
"I recently had a conference at Le Meridien Phoenix Ballroom where i received one of the best hospitality from Manish Jr.  Although, i met him during the lunch breaks and snack breaks only but still he managed to win my heart and i saw him greeting other friends of mine very well.  I highly recommend Le Meridien for hosting business conferences.  Thanks  ",5
"I always look forward to being at the Le Meridien Gurgaon. All the staff members here are extremely helpful and the decor and ambiance are amazing. Disha (front desk), Vandana (front desk), Mr. Das (club lounge) have been very committed to making our stay outstanding.   We we're given a very nice upgraded room. Disha went out of her way to fulfill our special requirements!   Thanks to all the staff at the hotel. 100% would recommend this place to friends and family!",5
"It was nice experience with Le Meridien Gurgaon.. First of all I thanks to all the staff. The front desk staff was very friendly, cooperative with excellent service and They always keep smile on their faces. Every single person I met was professional, cordial, and went out of their way to make me feel at home. Property is good and well maintain. Rooms are clean with all basic needs.

Dinner buffet is all time great and all dishes taste great , Thanks to the Executive Chef of the hotel.Every staff member make you feel spacial and makes your stay member able.",5
"We had booked 1 executive suite and 1 club room. The suite room was appropriate in terms of facilities and interiors though the club room was not satisfactory at all. The size of club room was small or placement of furniture was not justified. One door of  wardrobe was not accessible due to the bed side table placement. The luggage table was small and still hindering the walking space between itself and the bed. When we checked in the electrically operated blind did not work and we had to call the house keeping to fix it which took them 30 minutes and I had to wait in the corridor with my wife and 3 months daughter. My wife got locked in the bathroom as the sliding door lock malfunctioned, which was repaired later.  I believe Le Meridian could do better than this in maintaining",4
"Every touch point with each and every staff member of the hotel was delightful. They made me feel special and made the stay truely memorable. Sucheta from front office was  fantastic. She made check-in and check-out smooth. Took care of every single details. Once during my stay, my key was not working so i just walked up to the Executive Lounge (11th floor). The hotel associate actually went all the way down and got a replacement key. This shows the level of commitment of the hotel staff for the guests. Keep it up. Look forward to more such memorable experiences.",5
"Was greeted and welcome by Vandana Kanojia upon my arrive at hotel.  Paperwork for check-in was all pre-prepared and I was escorted up to my room.  Best check-in experience I had for a long time.  Throughout my stay, the hospitality and service was excellent.",5

"A very refined architectural setting to spend some time in. We were ushered into our room by the amaible Administrator Vandana, a delightful person. The Concierge Anuj Kumar proved himself to be of utmost service to us following a Passport theft of our Sikh God-Son Vikas Taneja while he was on a business trip to Seoul, South Korea. He placated our worries and got in contact with his colleague in Seoul on our behalf. A most efficient and amaiable man who we shall remember for coming to our assistance. The Restaurant had a fine choice of Food. The soup was of a high quality. I mentioned it and they ssaid it was due to a Chef they had `imported`1 from nepal. Very efficient Staff through-out the Hotel. Gourav Bhatnagar was of great assistance to us as well. He has an air of",5
"I have stayed couple of time in this property. Property stands out from city rush yet accessible to major commercial hub including airport.  This time I stayed for 3 nights for business and was overwhelmed by the service of the staff. The main highlight was greetings by each and every staff right from Door opener to HS staff and off-course Hotel reception and other staff.   They have great spread of Breakfast to start great day. Rooms are large and well maintained, HS staffs do the cleaning on specified time unlike some hotels were you could see HS staff walking in at 4 PM for regular services.  Few suggestions on spread of Breakfast requires improvement at Executive Lounge.  At any point of time,I would recommend to stay not only business traveler but with family.  It's worth a",5
"I stayed with this hotel for 3 nights and the staff is really  nice and friendly,specially Vandana and Adil And DK was really nice. I would really like to recommend this hotel to my friends and will definitely come back here again.",5
Service at Le Meridien Gurgaon is incredible. The staff treats you as if you are there first priority. The concierge will handle any request made with a smile on their face. Also the drivers are super nice. Special shout outs to Anuj (chief concierge) and Nandlal (driver) who made my experience at this hotel incredible. Above and beyond expectations!,5
The food was pretty good and the rooms were also quite spacious. They have amazing views from the bathroom overlooking the city and the bathrooms were semi-automated with options to plug-in your iphone and play the music of your choice.,5

Ms. Kajal from guest relations greeted us and engaged our baby with warm smile. She briefed us on amenities of hotel and room. The Chefs Samaresh Das, and Om pal have ensured our appetite is satiated with versatile cuisines. My toddler daughter was happy to see Kajal, and Niteesh almost every time and played around in Foyer.  All in all the staff here made our stay comfortable with their wonderful hospitality, and pleasant smiles...",5
"I stayed at Le Meridien for business, therefore spent the majority of my time here!  For me, the location is perfect as it is only a short (depending on traffic) 30 minute drive to the airport.  However, there is nothing in the immediate vicinity, and I would not really like to walk anywhere from the hotel.  This is no problem, as the hotel has a fleet of cars and drivers to take you places.    The room was very nice.  There are lots of buttons on the wall next to the bed controlling different light patterns, one of which allows you to put on subdued lighting if you need to get up during the night.  The remote control black out blinds were also a nice touch.  I was on the 7th floor, and had a full length window in the bathroom as well as the main room, which meant the room was",5

The breakfast was another highlight with lots of variety and all very tasty. The location of the hotel is another plus point. All in all, it a wonderful hotel. I‚Äôd come back here any time. ",5

"I spent 5 days at the hotel and I got the chance to experience many of their efficient and professional services i.e. very fast laundry, well equipped gym, high talented and smart drivers, etc. The room was extremely clean, the food was excellent and very high qualitative, all the requests quickly offered. But, as it always happens, the main plus is given by the people, and on this Le M√©ridien Gurgaon has a fantastic staff. Everybody is extremely friendly and ready to support you. I won't ever forget the food from chef Aniket,he really puts love in what he makes, the service of Sunil and Kashish, who are very nice persons, the smile of Vardena, the welcome of Lucky and Manoj the driver. I truly recommend and I look forward to going there again.",5

"I visited the Le Meridian last month for breakfast buffet and since then it has become my top 5 breakfast joints. The Pancakes served by Chef Aniket personally has become one of the my favourite, along with the great taste in food the services provided by them is also wonderful. Most recommended if you need both the delicious taste and the amazing service.",5
"From the front staff to wait staff in coffee shop to on call help, the service is impeccable. The room( Suite) was very well organized. From decaf coffee( from my last trip request ) to welcome macrons and apples were a good surprise.   Cleaning crew every day did better job then the last day. Will recommend this hotel above any other in Gurgaon.",5
I am currently staying in this hotel and i must say the staff is really nice and they are taking care of me as well.

Recently I have had a opportunity to visit this place. I was craving for some good exotic breakfast after tiring sleepless night at office.... I must say the kind of hospitality is something I didnt expected. There was chef Aniket and chef gaurav singh who assisted me to choose from long list of dishes across cuisine....I ordered chocolate waffle on the recommendation of chef Aniket and it was so beautifully garnished and amazingly that....if I have to sum up it was treat to my eyes and taste buds...it was just awesome.... Definitely I m gonna visit again whenever I am in Delhi....thanks le meridian - latest recipe for such a wonderful breakfast....,5
"Comfortable and hassle free stay always. The food is great too. Special mention for Chefs Anil Kumar and Gaurav Singh who can be seen meeting guests, tweaking recipes to individual preferences and always smiling and eager to help. Quite often I have been served at the table by one of them and that is quite remarkable really. There‚Äôs also a silent but cheerful and pleasant young man in Housekeeping Mr Rakesh Rawat who i regularly encounter during my stays. He‚Äôs very dedicated and meticulous in servicing the room. I‚Äôm sure there are many more of the staff that make it a warm and pleasant stay always.",4
"It was my 10+ visit to Le Meridian again, and have been quite good experience again.

While the hotel has all the standard amenities of most 5 star hotels, what really sets it apart is a wonderful team of people, who make sure that all the guests have a relaxing and well looked after stay.

We went to the coffee shop for dinner. And had a soup and salad buffet and my side ordered a Kathi roll. The green chutney served with it was amazing. And the chef Heerdham singh suggested he bring the garlic chutney to taste. Both were Amazing. The food has improved with every dish being little more tasty and the service is on point. Excellent food and service we will be coming for more. ,5
"Came here for a leisure travel. It was great stay. The service provided was great, from the food service to the check-in and check-out.  Had the all at the hotel itself. Although, the dinner order took some time to be served, the executive at the Latest Recipe (I guess Ashish) offered us snacks from the buffet which was really nice. Vicky at the front desk was great when it came to upgrading the room and doing a smooth check-out and was the point of contact throughout the stay. On the other hand, the rooms need a bit of renovation.   Great work guys. Keep up!",5
"Really enjoyed the stay here in this hotel. I have stayed in many hotels around the best and this is among one of them.

"I had stayed for 2 nights in this hotel for my business visit. Since it was a 5 star hotel, I fairly assumed assumed that it will take care of the basis infrastructure like good bed, water, air quality etc  I was actually shocked when i got water from rusted pipes in the wash basin which i incidentally used it for washing my face and some got ingested while brushing. This kind of callousness was never expected in a 5 Star rated hospital. I wanted to upload the video for the benefit of everyone but there is no provision for that.  Would suggest travelers to keep in mind of this fact and avoid going to this hotel.   Regards",3
"Stayed a night at the hotel. We checked in late and had dinner (buffet) at the Coffee Shop .. the variety was good however food did not seem fresh and service for breads etc was quite slow  Rooms are excellent and provide great sleep. Breakfast is great and so is the Club Lounge area.  The Pool area is a complete disaster .. kept dirty, water also has a stink .. go near the sides and you will jump out of the water. The surrounding area is not kept clean as one would expect of a luxury hotel.",4
"Had a great stay! Right from the check in until the check out, everything was seamless. Anurag DM and Rishabh from FD were very helpful. The room given was very spacious and had all the modern amenities. Will be back again soon!",5
"After attending a wedding party in England, I felt at home staying back in LeMeridian, Gurgaon. I had a hectic business meetings schedule in this trip. Superb hospitality, great personal care, and friendly atmosphere at this hotel, kept me going. On arrival, driver was waiting with a big smile to drive me to the hotel. My check in was already done, driver handed me the keys in the car. After I came back from work, Nitesh and Disha were waiting in the reception to give me a warm welcome back and guided me to the newly renovated club lounge with a new floor and new decors. Very relaxing and family atmosphere!! Jatin, Amar and the chef Shahbaz took a great personal care!! How can a forget refreshing bailey coffee from DK, Always Amazing experience!!",5
"Amazingly furnished suite, with an equally amazing view of vast green expanses of Delhi Gurgaon border. The property is newly built and has all the modern amenities.

All of the staff, especially Disha, is super helpful and went above and beyond to make sure that anything and everything was beyond perfect.",5
"Undoubtedly staying here was the best service experience I have had in all my travels around the world, which includes US, UK, Europe, India, China, Taiwan, Sri Lanka.  I'm not saying that there are not better hotels out there, but the level of above and beyond service you will get here is unmatched.  I'll give couple expamples: 1. I told them I'm checking out today, but my flight is much later in the evening. So they extended my checkout time to 5pm. This might not be standard, but I was amazed that they accommodated my request.  2. Several times they delivered the breakfast buffet directly to my room, and even served breakfast when I arrived after breakfast time was over.  3. At the breakfast buffet, the staff told me that if there is anything I don't see in the buffet, they",5
"Le meridian Gurgaon gave me a real 5 star experience starting right from their restaurant, rooms, staff.  Food was yummy to the core with various varieties, personalised touch given by the head chef was amazing- he personally assured that I eat my favourite dishes which were not their in the menu as it was my birthday. Location if the hotel is also very prime and connected to Gurgaon and Delhi.. Must go for a weekend getaway",5
"Super nice stay, Rooms all good. Special mention of Front end staff and Very Special Chef Anil Kumar and Gaurav who take care of me in Breakfast and Lunch    Rooms were clean and very friendly are the housekeeping staff",5
I have been staying at this hotel for last 4 months on a buissness project and have enjoyed the great hospitality entire staff has offered.  I would like to thank Entire lounge staff Rahul/jatin / reetu/ chef shabaz/ chef Das who always what I needed for breakfast and dinner.   The logistics staff anuj/Ashish/Vicky do a great job for my pick ups and drops   The restaurants are offering quite a good food options and again Lucky / DK/Chef Gaurav do an excellent job.  Also the customer service team of Kajal and Vandana and Diana do take care of all my requirements from my personal choice of fruits / decor in room   Overall I can‚Äôt praise more about this hotel staff / facilities and hospitality.  Again might have forgotten. A few names but your team rocks,5

Special mention of Abhishek andGgurav from Fand B for the personal care. On the whole, it was a memorable experience.",4
"The staff is wonderfully friendly and courteous and made my stay unforgettable. I have interacted with Nihkl in restaurant every morning and he makes me feel happy and fun. I think he is my friend. When I forgot to take my clothes in a chair, he kept it and give me later. It was touched. Regarding facilities in hotel, it's also great. The club lounge had a good selection of food and drinks and I recommend brunch of the italian restaurant, Belacucina. Moreover it's very convenient to use hotel car from hotel to office. Thanks for making my stay lovely and comfortable to my friendly staff.",5
Everybody should come here to visit this place you never walk away disappointed... and if you visit it definitely I ask for a Vandana or Kajal - this girls will help u with anything ant for food and drink away ask for a Luckly or DK - they are the best...,5
I have been a traveler for more than 28 years due to work and I have to all major hotels in the world. I have to say that Le Meridian Gugaon in Delhi can be described as the hotel having the best treatment of clients than any other hotel I have been to. The staff go miles out of their way to try and provide for the needs of the customer.i can‚Äôt mention names because I don‚Äôt want to forget anyone but the moment you arrive you are at home and everybody is there for you.thank you all  for outstanding performance,5
"Once this hotel used to be really upbeat but from past couple of months, the service is going down be it rooms, room service or food. The staff is always ready with an apology but waiting when the suggestions would be implemented. ",3
"Nice hotel very good food !! Nice staff  Great job !! Very clean , very educated , good morning and good evening always ! authentic 5 star hotel . Room super clean !  Rakesh ( housekeeping) he do  fantastic and super fantastic job  ",5
I commented on the room and service of the room earlier too. I found much more better service apart from nice room My check in was just excellent by the Duty Manager. Who was well mannered and exceedingly professional.The room was as good as always. This time I found the lounge service had improved a lot. Particularly due to Ms Reetu. She was just too accommodating and helpful. Room service and food was excellent too. Another good thing I found this time is check in assistance at the air port. It was amazing. I sincerely thanks to Duty Manager and the staff at the Airport to make our departure wonderful too.,5
"I have been to India for business purpose and I stayed at Le Meridien I must say it's an great hotel with really good staff Special mention to Amar ,Pooja who were really helpful through my stay. The Spa services is also really great , housekeeping team is a little slow but not a problem I can understand that the hotels are busy and they cannot be there 24/7. Otherwise everything was perfect I really enjoyed it.",5
"I was there for 10 days, rooms are nice and clean. Food was great, in both restaurant, bud I recommend go to hotel restaurant Bella Cucina. Best on this hotel is very friendly and helpful personal, especially Pooja, Rahul, Reetu Ravin and Raman. If you need decent internet connection, then go for upgrade, standard speed is quite slow. Only thing that was bugging me from time to time was a hotel taxi service, because drivers were usually late.",4
Such a lovely hotel and facilities. The staff were very friendly and the food was amazing at La Cucina and the breakfast buffet. The rooms have bathtubs in them which is wonderful. The guys at the spa look like they could give you a great massage also. ,5
"This is not a bad place and our conference experience was average.  The room was in the basement, two floors below the lobby and was poorly ventilated and dark.  It alternated between freezing cold And stifling heat.  The A/v worked and was well supported and the service was fine.  When I asked them for a Diet Coke it kind of took them out of their box for a bit, but they recovered.  It is worth doing a conference here because of the buffet lunch - that was simply awesome.  But having our conferees go two floors down and watch the sunlight disappear in the elevator? That‚Äôs pretty much meh. ",3
"It was a short stay though but loved it, staff is really nice specially food , loved the lavish breakfast .  It is a beautiful property run by amazing set of staff. Would definitely visit again.  Thank you all. ",5
"Went their on the New Year Party . Excellent hospitality. Easy check in. Very polite and friendly staff. The rooms are very well maintained . they offer a Champagne breakfast, which was very nice with umpteen choices.  Parties and evening at CANDY are really awesome.   Recommend this hotel",5

"Wonderfully located with a scenic beauty and serenity.  However, the breakfast can still be enhanced on spread and quality. The rooms are very well maintained and the same time the staff are really helpful with a great friendly gesture.",4
Nice clean rooms. Staff was friendly and helpful. The beds were comfy. There were a lot power outages.. I guess it is the norm in Gurgaon. Location is close to global business park thats why I had chosen this hotel. The Indian food in the restaurant was just about average but the breakfast was very nice with umpteen choices. Will definitely stay again,4
I visited with my parents for there 25th wedding anniversary. The ambience is really good. Moreover the staff and the Food at Latest recipe is really awesome. And the fragrance in the lobby was soo pleasing n fresh i just loved it.  :)) ,5
"The Le Meridien in Gurgaon is a great and modern hotel to stay at either as a business traveller or private. It¬¥s big, modern and comfortable makes you feel at home. Especially the firm beds are good. I always sleep like a baby there. The staff is service minded, helpful and available over all expectations. You can basically get anything you want when you want it. I always enjoy my stays at the Le Meridien. Everyone there knows you and it is a bit like home away from home. Prices are absolutely fair and both the buffet restaurant as well as the Italian restaurant are great places to eat.",5

"Amazing hotel with a pleasant business lounge and the whole service and front desk team  was great mainly Amar, Reetu, Rahul, Dipika, Kajal ... thank you very much! Perfect food was there mainly chefs like chef das and chef krishnendu",5
"This is a franchisee of the group and in no way connected to the Delhi hotel with its good service.  We had an extremely poor experience at this hotel in its early days.  Wrong menus on zomato, restaurants were closed, and the only one open had no menu so one didn't know the charges.  It was over-price and when one pointed all this out to the management later, instead of an apology and a show of regret they became defensive and rude.  Lost me as a customer.  The Delhi group said they could not do anything about it but tried their best to help.",1
"As a returning guest, staffs ensures at all times my preferences are guaranteed. This brings lot of comfort every time. Guest relation has enhanced much better than before. Suggest pool side attendance added/increased in order to maintain hygiene.",4
"I reallly enjoyed my stay the hotel is really beautiful and the service is excellent. Special mention to the Club Lounge, Amar was really excellent with his service team he was always there to help me out throughout my stay he is really doing a great job.",5

"My first time in india , and a fantastic reception at Le Meridien.  Very comfortable room, good restaurants but it is the staff that make the stay outstanding.  Nothing is too much trouble, always welcoming and helpful, and warm and approachable too.  A real delight, especially given that I am staying here for two weeks!  One of the managers, ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô and the waiters ‚ÄòSunil‚Äô shone very single evening.  Simply outstanding!!",5

Liked the rooms and view from my room. Really clean and modern. I got a suite upgrade (I had to argue for it as they told me a day before that they upgraded me to a suite and then during checkin I was told that suites are not available). I'm a platinum member.  Club lounge is really nice with great food options. ITC Maurya Sheraton should follow this hotel as their lounge sucks.  Recommend this hotel.,5

They arranged cake for us to make our day special and memorable. i would really like to recommendthis hotel to my family and friends. And i would like to celebratey anniversary here again but will definetlycome with my family.. Jayam from Front Office checked me in. was very kind. Thank you all for such a pleasant stay.,5

"Had a very nice,happy and comfortable stay from 10th May -17th May 2018. Rooms are good and clean.

Looking forward for another stay soon :-)",5
"The hotel is conveniently located for my work needs, and is just a short drive to the airport. The room I was in was very clean and comfortable. The staff in the hotel are wonderfully friendly and courteous. I used the hotel cars to travel to and from the office, and the Concierge team were excellent at organising this for me. The club lounge had a good selection of food and drinks of an evening, service here could sometimes be a little slow, but still always done with a smile!",5

"I was here for a couple of days on a business trip. The place had one of the best breakfast spreads I have ever had, especially the eggs. The rooms are very comfortable and the bathroom is quite big. Overall an amazing experience",5
One of the best hotels I have ever travelled to right from the beginning they will help you out with what ever your query is this is what you expect from a 5 star hotel.  The Duty Manger Rahul was really a great person just had a small conversation at time of check out. Sanchit was exceptional at Club Lounge then Rupesh in Housekeeping missing some names like the guy at check in... But over all 5 star for the property and team.  ,5
"Le Meridien hotel staff is very kind and made my stay unforgettable . Vandana is very kind and beautiful and helped me a lot  . She introduced me with Indian culture. Sunil from the restaurant is very prompt always ready to help... I would like to stay here again and again as it is very convenient, near to my office and i really liked the food specially dinner..Thank you for making my stay lovely and comfortable. ",5
"It‚Äôs the feeling of being valued when I visit Le Meridian. I have been coming very regularly in past 6 months to this property, each time I feel valued from the time reservation is made till I check out. The rooms are very comfortable and suits me well. The location is perfect for business meetings in Gurgaon. To top it all,staff is extremely caring. I recommend this place always for business or personal meetings. Look forward to come back again.",5
"me and my wife stayed on transit in Le-Meridien Gurgaon.Check-in was very smooth, breakfast was also very elabourated. all staff were having smile on there faces in restaurant and really very helpful. me and my wife wanted to give special thanks to Asmita Singh at guest service centre but unfortunately we couldn't meet her upon check-out. she was very polite while handling the calls, she has the best hospitality tactics we have ever seen and she is really a great asset in your company's growth.  we will definitely recommend this hotel to our relatives and friends too.",4
It is a beautifully designed and well maintained property with great ambience. You surely will enjoy a overnight stay with your family and your friends whosoever you want to go with. Food is good as well.,5
Special thanks to Tennyson from spa and Jaidev from restaurant. You guys are Rockstars of the hotel. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality. I'll be coming to this hotel again only to experience your hospitality. Once again thank you Jaidev and Tennyson. You guys do an wonderful job. Hotel should always take care of such staff.,5

Very well managed property with spacious room and Amenities. Breakfast with a great selection of food. Quick service at Check in/out. Good choice of restaurants for dinner. Overall a great experience!,5
"This was the last stop of our golden triangle tour. Our room and the restaurant buffet were both stunning and consistent with the quality you associate with Le Meridien. Albeit the restaurant is at european prices. However, the pool was really disappointing. There was a bad smell emanating from the neighbouring property/site (I think it was a water treatment works) and as a result lots of bugs/flies which we didn't experience anywhere else in India.  The hotel is pretty remote if you are on a tour. So as long as the pool and location aren't important factors book it.",3
"The food here was amazing brought by equally amazing Kartic. I had ordered truffle mushroom pizza 12"". The order came in about 20 mins and was delicious.  Kartic was very courteous and professional in his dealing.",5
"f you are looking for a mid week sojourn into tranquility, step into a haven of comfort and bliss at the spa in Le Meridien Gurgaon. Nestled amidst the posh location of Gurgaon, Le Meridien stands tall with opulence that is hard to describe. The interiors of the hotel have taste that matches an artistic prelude. The Colorful lobby with a display of the finest artworks gives life to the hotel while the echoing vibrations of sophistication take you to a higher level.    Welcoming diners artistically I was invited to review their spa that has already acquired praises from guests. The spa is located in the basement, joining hands with the i-kandy bar and the salon. A large pool beckons in the outdoors where families can be seen enjoying a cool dip in the sweltering month of July. ",5
"All staff especially in reception and at lounge were excellent and took good care of myself. Those consideration made my stay really comfortable. Around 2 weeks after check-out, I visited the hotel for a request. Then one staff (Vandana) still remember my name at the sight of me and tried to solve my request. I felt it was like a family.",5
Went for SPA Therapy this weekend.  Nice ambience with soothing music. Staff was very kind and courteous.  Therapist Laxmi was very good.   Quite relaxing weekend experience overall......... Would definitely try to go again !!!!!,5
"I use to stay here multiple times from February 2016 and have to say thank you for the management that they are keen to satisfy guests which keep healthy life-style in they routine. You will find here proper food, 24 hrs gym, 25 meters swimming pool and cherry on the top - SPA which works till very late evening, actually till 2AM!",5

Best service provider in the city. I would love to come over again to feel special. Your staff is the main asset of your organization. I would like to take the names of Jatin in club lounge. Mr.Anurag @ front desk was kind enough to take care of our stay & in the end I would like to thank Kajal for the cake & fruits.,5
The hotel is good and the ambience also good. Hospitality is great and I really liked their service.  Food at latest recipe is also good not exceptional but good and also their I-candy is a cool place to visit too.,4
"Hotel is contemporary, clean, and offers a fresh/modern feel.   Rooms are well laid out. Spacious and clean. Lot of effort has gone to the decor, though the extremely poor quality workmanship is dragging this property down. They can sue their builder, if they like, however, full marks to the planner and design team.   Few interesting observations - TV channels are very limited, which is very surprising this being Delhi. Room dining options are very limited, i cant understand why it is always around daal, paneer, chicken, and mutton dishes (1-2 types each) in these menus, keeping the length and breadth of the Indian cuisine in mind which is admired globally.  Thanks Chef Gaurav who came to the rescue with some simple and home-made kind of options. Laundry was not sure whether it",3
Great place and great team @ Le Gurgaon. Like to stay again and again whenever visit Delhi. Specially I appreciate front desk team as well Launge club team for take care as required. At restaurant Abhijeet Vishwajit  has taken good care of my food choices as frequently I am visiting hotel. Thanks to all team.,5
"On being a Platinum member we were invited by traditional tilak for each guest and had a smooth check-in process. Further, we received complimentary fruits and sweets at our room. The relationship manager ensured to provide us with a tour of the hotel and made us feel comfortable since the time we stepped in. The breakfast had a great spread of Indian and Continental options. the rooms are quite tech savvy with different options for lighting depending on one's mood. The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the stay. Thank you!",5
I had gone to stay in the Le Meridien with my family and found it to be a decent hotel with relatively cheaper room rates. The customer service is pretty average. I found the food to be good. The room size is decent too.  The hotel is easy to locate as it is present just off the main highway.,4
"My stay was comfortable, nice location with nice people working at the hotel. The SPG recognition was excellent and I felt like home.  The welcome back and departure was excellent and thanks to Sahiban at the front desk for making it more comfortable and reminding me with my SPG benefits. :)",5
"Had a good stay at Le Meridien. The hotel is nice and rooms are big in size and comfortable. Lot of attractive facilities are available inside the room and room service is nice as well. The food was good in taste, though for breakfast the options for Veggies are bit less as compared to some of other hotels. Staff are polite and check-in/out process is very smooth. Overall the stay was fine. Location wise the only drawback is, its bit away from market place.",4
"I visit on a regular almost monthly basis and primarily arriving to Delhi airport, but with business meetings in both Gurgaon and Delhi.  For anyone who has experienced the traffic travelling from Delhi to Gurgaon or the other way can be a traffic jam nightmare.  In that sense the Le Meridien Gurgaon is conveniently located in between and with excellent access to both MG Road as well as the Delhi expressway.  It is also within 20-30 minutes of Delhi airport which enables arrival and departure planning to be easier  Add to that the hotel is of high quality from restaurants to rooms and with attentive and friendly service that is always professional from the front desk to restaurants, concierge and room service.  This trip a new addition to the front desk, Ms Vandana was very",5
"I often visit Gurgaon in connection to my work and I always stay on Le Meridien in Gurgaon. The hotel fulfil my needs even there are many private parties and that can sometimes result in a lot of noise and it get crowdy not only in the banquet facilities.  The hotel staff are very friendly and service minded and will do everything they can to get a good experience. I will like to mention Jitesh, DK, Avishek, Sunil and Gaurav in the restaurants. Gaurav arrange that I get special Danish ""rugbr√∏d"" made and that keeps my stomach well, thank you! And in the Spa Laxmi and in the club lounge Rahul have made my life easier.",5
"I visit Delhi every month for work in the last 1 year and have stayed in Le Meridien Gurgaon during my last 5 stays. I just love the hotel because of it's accessibility and location. It's green, beautiful and peaceful at the same time. The staff are really friendly. The price is also very resonable compared to the other star hotels around.",5
"The hotel is very good with nice maintenance and house keeping.  The Power Breakfast offered keeps you going for the day. However, location is not great since one has to drive thru traffic from Delhi Airport.",4
"One of the best hotels in terms of stay, location being  slightly away from busty noisy traffic  especially if  you are looking your stay at Gurgaon. The thing which stands out the options available for food, lovely menu for all three meals... enjoying it... in room dining experience has been very good especially the courteous staff... Kartic has been good...kudos to the staff and management. Room upkeep has been good so far. Thanks",4
"The hotel was great and more so the staff who were very friendly at each meal and very hospitable, kind, and always smiling. Location is central to business and fun areas in Gurgaon. Highly recommended!",5
"The location of the property makes it an excellent choice for a quick in & out into Gurugram. while the rooms are slightly dated and could be a little roomier, for business travel it is perfect. Also, the breakfast is excellent. No lunch needed :)",4
"I was pleasantly surprised by the property. Its located very close to the DLF Cyber city. So, if you have business/work in Cyber City, this is perfect place to stay.  Its a pretty modern hotel. The rooms decor was excellent, and the staff was very friendly. I would stay here again!",5
"The hotel is well located with good access to many of the business centres in the area. I have not tried any of the restaurants, but my experience with the front desk staff was very good, they were all very helpful. The SPG recognition was excellent, and I felt very welcome. The lobby bar staff are sometimes a bit slow to turn around the orders but again, overall a very good experience. Happy to return.",4
"Nice swimming pool, good facilities and great quality  food - especially Sunday brunch, very complete buffet! Typical for wedding celebration! Photo attached! Store with beautiful souvenirs also present!",5
"Had the opportunity to stay at this hotel due to business in the area. Overall, service at this hotel was very good and most of the staff were attentive and welcoming. Hardware wise, the room that I'd stayed was showing signs of wear and tear but overall nothing major to complain about. Only thing that bothered me was the overpowering smell of paint or construction that lingered along the corridors of 8th floor as they were doing up 3 rooms during my stay. Breakfast at the hotel was also equally good with a good spread between east and west while the pastries are a must try.",4
"Recently visited the Hotel and had a nights stay. The overall ambience is good with good food and courteous staff, however the entire floors and rooms have wall to wall carpet that literally gives the stale smell and puts off the charm. Except the carpets smell issue, the overall experience has been good.",4
"Mine was a short business stay in April of 2018. I had stayed here before,  I believe in the year 2016, but never returned as I had options in Gurgaon.  But I am glad I chose to check in once again. What made it special this time was the overall feeling of warmth in the staff. They were genuinely nice and caring, not just made-up like in other hotels. Especially Kajal, she actually spent half an hour showing me around the property and also got me a cup of nice Latte :)",5
"It was yet another great experience at the Hotels Salon - all thanks to the wonderful staff especially the Hair Dresser Mr Tennyson, who not only gave a great hair cut, also is extremely polite patient and has an eye to detail.  ",5
It was my first stay in the hotel. Really love the staff of the hotel. Warm welcome by front office staff. Special thanks to Ms. Kajal from front office staff for giving me the smoking room. Will come soon again  My room no. Was 844,5
Recently I along with my family visited this hotel for lunch Really the lunch was amazing and they have wide variety of options to choose from We really enjoyed. Great taste so price doesn‚Äôt make any difference  All in all a great experience...,5
"This hotel is convenient for Delhi airport. Rooms are beautifully decorated and are well appointed. Our room had a separate bath & shower, tea making facilities, mini bar and Bose sound dock. We tried the Italian restaurant for dinner. The food was delicious. Staff in hotel & restaurant were very accommodating, they refused tips and asked us to review them on trip advisor instead!! There is a spa and it's open until 2am however it's very busy & we were unable to book a convenient appointment time. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5
"The hotel know how to make you feel special in a warm welcome and attention to detail ! Thank you. Kajal welcomed me and accompanied to my room for a speedy check in, she was warm and friendly and very polite, as are all the staff.",3
The lounge team always send the warm welcome when you entering the lounge. The needs will be fulfilled by the staff who are very caring and passionate. Amar has been asking feedback from the hotel guest and help the guest to have a better stay.,5
I would like to start with check-in was perfectly took  by  girl (sorry i don't remember the name but she was alone at the time) her welcoming skill is too good. she given us room on 8th floor #831 room was good with a great view. we did not taken the much services but what we have taken was great . As a hotelier i must say it was a great experience.    The staff are genuinely concerned about customer satisfaction and are working to deliver the service levels that the Marriott  is renowned for.,5

Everything seems to be immaculately cotton themed white in this hotel... looks as austere as a Chapel actually.  A row of picture windows in the coffee shop and a large skylight adds a distinct persona to the place. It's perky during the day and peppy by the night.  While we were deciding between eating at their Italian restaurant and the coffee shop, one look at the magnitude of the daily dinner buffet spread and Latest Recipe it was.

Had dosa‚Äôs, samosas and masala omelette every morning while my son had fresh made pancakes every day.  Excellent!!  I would give five stars but the room, while very nice, was a little dirty and had some weird / confusing lighting controls. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to all travelers as the price is right and the staff is excellent. ",4

The staff were impeccably polite and attentive. No request was too big.  They jumped to help right away. Each of them humble, well dressed and warm.   The room was spacious and had everything I needed (except perhaps a fridge).  The food was really great in that there was a great deal of choice so, as a first timer in India, I could sample curries or go for more plain, familiar fare when my stomach was not 100%.

"We had the Sunday Brunch at Le Meridien Gurgaon on March 18, 2018 but the experience was quite underwhelming. The concept of a Grand Sunday Brunch combining all restaurants is definitely great but somehow for us it fell way short of what it proclaimed.   In the service industry there are mainly two mantras for success - People & Process. The Le Meridien, Gurgaon falls short on both these important parameters.   We‚Äôd like to summarise our experience in the following points:  1. The spread looks vast and inviting, but when one actually starts tasting each preparation you realise that nothing really stands out when it comes to flavour and it‚Äôs just run of the mill.   2. The Indian section was definitely sad with all the Biryani‚Äôs and curies being sub par, the only exception being",1

Sunil, one of the staff members made great martinis and was always so nice, the chefs at the buffet as well and the managers were a delight to be around. They took excellent care of me and by my second day pretty much new what I liked and took very good care of my orders, foods and drinks. I would definitely come back and highly recommend this place to anyone. Like I said the staff was the best part, if I had more space I'd write down all the names but truly they were all amazing.

I regularly stay at Le Meridian in Gurgaon as it is conveniently located for Cyber city and is reactively cheap. It is cheaper with good reason the hotel needs a refurb (definitely not 5* as advertised) The bedrooms and in particular bathrooms have seen better days. If you are staying make sure you get a room at the front of the hotel as rooms at the back are often disturbed by parties in I-Kandy bar.,3
"Lovely public areas, staff very helpful. Rooms ever so slightly tired in patches, but not that you'd notice without looking closely.  No hooks in the bathroom annoyed me, nowhere to hang your towel to dry once you had used it. Amazing shower. Incredible buffet restaurant!",5
"We have been coming to this hotel for 6 years. Even though we live in Gurgaon, it is a great getaway to re-charge our batteries. We have seen many changes over the years and this time it was that afternoon tea with substantial snacks are no longer served in the Club lounge. My husband was not happy and wrote a negative review. The response has been instant and amazing. The staff on all levels have gone out of their way to ensure that we had a lovely weekend and any lingering dissatisfaction was completely gone.It is impossible to single out the many staff for special mention as they were all fantastic. It is great to see 'old friends' on the staff who always welcome us like family. We will continue to celebrate our special occasions here.",5
"Everything about Le Meridien was first class.   The desk operation was efficient, staff could not do enough and the room was very, very comfortable.  The two most important things - the bed and the shower - were both outstanding. I have never seen such a wide choice for breakfast and the room service meal we ate was also excellent. We were probably one of the first guests to walk from the hotel to the metro station as it was very close, even if it meant hiking down the edge of a major road.  Round trip to the major shopping mall area in Gurgaon for two was 80 rupees!",5
"Located in Gurugram, this place is such a beauty with all the amenities.  We went here for one night stay.  The offerings and services are so good. Rooms are so beautifully made with all basic amenities.  Breakfast buffet is absolutely lavish. You will love the food variety and taste.   I am sure to revisit them because of their services. ",5
"I was absolutely satisfied with the services provided in Le Meridien hotel. My big thanks belongs to restaurant services- breakfast in the morning, lounge in the evning (11th floor)- absolutely perfect. I have to highlight as well guys working in gym- always friendly, helpful. The same about receptionist. Thank you everybody :)",5
"We've been regular guests at the hotel for the last 6 years. During our stays the Club Lounge was always a favourite. Great high teas in the afternoon & then super snacks & drinks from 6pm to 8pm. During our last trip we noticed the standard of the high tea  & snacks had fallen significantly, which was disappointing.   We checked in for 2 nights today to escape the Holi crowds. Went down for high tea anticipating some light snacks & a coffee only to learn that high tea is no longer served!!  Anyway, the coffee was good.  We've also noticed over time that some of the really special buffet items we enjoyed have disappeared.  The hotel is still very pleasant and the staff lovely. It's a pity that catering standards have dropped as it's always disappointing when one's reasonable",3
My stay at this hotel was pleasant. Service was good daily room cleaning. Breakfast spread was really nice. Just an advice that the management checks on the washroom fittings as well since there was a clogged basin in the room which I was provided,4
"I love this hotel! Top to bottom the staff are terrific and help with any issue or with a smile and welcome back. The hotel was packed with a wedding so as a platinum guest they upgraded my wife and I to the Presidential Suite. I‚Äôve lived in apartments smaller than that! Stay here you‚Äôll love the food, lounge, staff and rooms. ",5
"I had been booked into this particular hotel during the last week of the year for work purposes. In comparison to all the other hotels I have stayed at, this one stands out for the services provided, and in particular the attentiveness of its staff. The restaurant also makes really good food and the location is great for connectivity as it is very close to the metro and also not very far from the airport. Would highly recommend it and also appreciate Mr.Manish Kumar, FOA who was always very cheerful in all his interactions which is always a welcome sight.",5
"Le Meridien in Gurgaon (there are 2 in Delhi) this one is about 30 mins from the airport.  There are closer hotels in Aero City (about 5 -8 mins from the airport), but this one is much better all around.  There was a mix up with my room, but Anuraj did a great job and fixed everything on my behalf.  The lunch buffet food was excellent - really nice quality & taste.   The service was not great.  The 11th-floor club lounge was excellent!  Great food & drinks - worth the upgrade.  Taxi to or from airport is 500 INR - Innova minivan (hotel car) is 2,500 each way.",4
"I had stayed in Le Meridien, Gurgaon for 2 nights along with my friends. The staff was really helpful. The room was auto-upgraded to a Suite because of my Platinum membership with SPG. The food was also good, overall a good experience.",5
"We stayed here for 4 days. The hotel is nice, but it is definitely not 5*. The accumulation of small issues made our stay unpleasant:  - The staff / service were polite but incredibly slow. We often waited over an hour to get a beer served at the pool  - The bathrooms were dirty and the shower gutters didn't work, causing constant flooding  - The elevators were useless, you'd often find yourself waiting for 15min to go down 2 floors  - We had to switch rooms because there was a wedding happening outside of our room at 1am (2nd floor)  - The pool was absolutely freezing cold  - The pool was often being used for weddings and events, meaning that guests were unable to use it. There would be zero communication about this. We were driven to the Courtyard Marriot 15mins away to use",2
One of the best Hotel i have ever found in delhi NCR with an amazing hospitality from Mr. Nikhil Kaul - 8826767992. You guys should give him an reward for his courage and politeness with the customer as he posses the overall quality that one should have to handle and arrange everything and making everything possible at his part. great accomodation and good service.,5
"Reception fast and friendly, with great service.  Room is nice, spacious. Little vet and mold in the corner of the room but seems manageable.  Bathroom spacious and clean.  Is a really business hotel, fully booked breakfast, still is good flow and helpful staff",4
I came back to the hotel after 2 years and experienced exceptional service. In particular I will like to recommend Lucky Batra and Ranjit in the cafe. Lucky was kind enough to go out of the way to help me when he found out that I needed certain toiletries and did not have the time to go to the shops. Lucky went out of his way and bought these items for me in his time after his shif completion. I would greatly recommend this hotel to everyone. ,5
The hotel is a new property that has come up close to the Guru Dronacharya metro station. I was here was a one day workshop. The service is impeccable. They served us breakfast in the conference rooms. The food too is very good and the conference rooms are pretty well equipped.  Also visited this place for an office party by the pool. Once again the service and the food was very good.,5
"I've stayed here 5-6 times but this week was poor. Room system failed so was in the dark for 30 minutes. Pool area smelled of sewerage. Getting coffee at breakfast took two attempts. Then no taxis offered, only hotel car. There are better options in the area. ",2
Being a SPG member I generally prefer Le Meridien across India and this time I stayed at Delhi NCR along with my friends.  We interacted with many staff just to know about hoteliers life and we met with Mr. Nikhil from IRD who is the real hero. I wish I could be a hotelier like him. He was very proactive and approachable. His hospitality will be memorable for us. Thankyou team Meridien for making our stay wonderful. Highly recommended hotel to stay for business purpose and not forget to meet Mr. Nikhil.,5
"While checking out I was informed that a bed accent in my room had burnt and that I was required to pay for it! I was sure that this NOT TRUE. So I asked them to produce the burnt object and also call the housekeeping staff who had reported this. Quite characteristically both failed to turn up! Further since the housekeeping staff had not entered the room on the day of checkout, why hadn't they brought it to my attention when they noticed it. In fact the housekeeping staff were constantly in and out of the room throughout my stay to put attend to various non functioning gadgets etc.",3
"I'm working in India more than two years and every time use to stay here once I'm in Gurugram. As permanent guest you will be surprised how hotel staff can shift expectation in the good way, every time welcome to resolve any routine or special request. Welcome to use their concierge service.",5
"After an adventurous tour of the South, landing at the Merridien was heavenly. Thanks to the entire staff for a super comfortable stay and many nice conversations. Felt very welcomed and well cared for. Special praise for the chefs creating an amazing breakfast each day and to Ranjeet for the smiles and great service!",5
"Front Desk  - Mr RAHUL was really attentive and was really good at reception . At Club Lounge‚Ä¶ Amar was really interactive and was very good with his service team which includes Jatin, Muneesh,Ajitav. Housekeeping  was really good at all times they provided everything  on time. Appreciated",5
"Being a SPG member, I usually stay at Le Meridien's when traveling. However, my experience at Le Meridien Gurgaon was average and unlike any other hotel I'd stayed at.  The hotel is run down and could use some new carpeting and renovations. Our first room smelled had a strong chemical odor so we had to request to switch rooms. Even in the second room, there were stains on the floor and the shower handle fell off when we tried using it. Just small things that could be updated to ensure that guests have a great visit -especially when staying at a more expensive hotel.   Wasn't a huge fan of this hotel! Would suggest staying at the other Le Meridien in Delhi.",3
"Clean, good food, ample complementary bottled water, friendly and helpful staff. The spa offers good massages. The Italian restaurant on site is fabulous! The sea bass and Rack of Lamb are highly recommended.",5
"Dear Sirs, I am very impressed with the services I received during my stay at Le Meridien, Delhi NCR. I recall I put three stickers in my room after my first night stay when I left the room.  1) I took out the batteries of the alarm clock as I didn't know how to stop the alarm sound at 12am. 2) The iron was water leak 3) I could not adjust the room temperature. It was always at 21.5 C. To my surprised, after my office work and I entered into my room and:  1) Alarm clock adjusted (no sound) 2) A iron was replaced 3) A heater was put in my room The waiters and waitresses were very polite.  Good customer satisfaction service. Well done.  ",5
United Airlines put us up here due to a flight cancellation.  My only disappointment is that we did not have more time to enjoy this hotel.  The accommodations and restaurant were excellent.  My only criticism would be their strange shower head.  It was hand held.,5
"Vikram and Anurag in front office were exceptional. Thank you for the amazing stay. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. Avishek in breakfast area was very attentive and Welcoming, enjoyed the buffet breakfast. ",5
"I had a 8 hours lay over in Delhi. I usually stay at the Aerocity which is closer to the airport but decided to give a chance Gurgaon and all honesty it was worth. Le M√©ridien had a delicious Indian/multi cuisine restaurant, Front Desk was superb and the waitres at the restaurant as well. I will stay again on the 22 of this month and I am looking forward to.",5
"Very courteous staff, and great food of course! Great ambience well connecting. Amritpal is a great guy, very cheerful! LIGHT MELLIFLUOUS MUSIC. WOULD LOVE TO VISIT IT AGAIN SOON. DO CHECK IT OUT OVER DINNER!",5
"Billing was wrong. Staff refuses to accept even though it is logically impossible for a person to eat in two restaurants simultaneously. No headphones in the gym. Gym instructor more keen on playing games on his phone, not concerned about the music playing. ",1
I am really not a demanding visitor but there are certain basic expectations.  Kitchen team was good.. was able to accomodate to my taste (4star to them)  Room was really very small.. I find Hongkong hotel rooms are far better than this. (For people who haven't been to.. hongkong is known for small spaces)  They tried to fit everything in a small room. My one bag couldn't even fit their space and took additional space to walk infront of bed which already had very less space.  Dining table was so small that it couldn't even accomodate the food tray.. really inconvenient.  You will find a working table too.. but will have hard time to move the chair.  Was out at work on return strong water leakage in CR.. fortunately it didn't spill towards bedroom where my laptop and other,2
"Hotel ambience is very nice the rooms are good with a lovely view. Food is also very good and the spread in buffet is always very good.Staff is always full of warmth and willing to go out of their way to help you and serve you. Especially people like Lucky, Rajat in fact all the staff.",5
"Modern, bright and comfortable hotel. Ideal location, around 30 minutes to and from airport.  Extremely nice staff, and specially Mr. Amar and Mr. Sagar from the lounge made the stay at the Le Meridien a perfect experience!",5
Had a good stay. Will stay here whenever possible. Staff here try and make you feel at home and go out of the way to provide you with all the comfort. Ambience and decoration in the room is also soothing.,5
"I had an exceptional experience staying at this hotel. Every single staff member was fantastic as they took care of my every need, the rooms were great and super comfortable and food at the lounge and the restaurant was delicious. The hotel has a nice outdoor pool and a well equipped gym with everything one would need for a workout on a trip. The spa is excellent! Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and will definitely stay here when I visit India next!",5
The Property is very beautiful and well managed. The rooms are apt and adequate for business travelers. some hotspots are few minutes away in case one wants to have fun. Courteous and polite staff.  A great stay overall!!,5
"We were living in one of the club rooms. This place is amazing in terms of the rooms, services, amenities and the hospitality. The food was great as well!  The ambience of the hotel is very welcoming and its so warm here. I am pretty impressed by the staff.   I had an amazing time at the i-Kandy, the poolside bar. It is the place to be if you enjoy good night life!",5
"Yet another excellent visit to this nicely located, well maintained property. Staff is excellent and buffet spread for breakfast is very good. View/ service at lounge was also worth appreciation. Overall - another excellent experience with this property ! ",5
"Staff is fantastic, they take care of you every moment, they are the very marking point of this hotel. Room large enough, bathroom clean and well provided. Breakfast with a lot of choice, from local to international food. Excellent transfer service. Check-in and check-out fast and clear. Wifi works very well. Fitness facility could be improved.",4
"I had the pleasure to spend in Le Meridien the last 4 weeks and have nothing but words of praise! Amazing service, very friendly, sincere staff and high standard, . Special thanks to Kumar Muneesh and Lucky Batra for being awesome and friendly companions, preparing amazing farewell dinner and making my stay unforgettable and to Shadan for keeping the room amazingly clean for the whole month!",5
"We used their conference rooms - 'Malay', 'Ione', 'Zeta' and 'Cygnus' over the course of a couple of weeks in January 2018. We found the infrastructure to be excellent with adequate facilities in each room as per our requirement. What really made the experience worth writing about was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. Whether it be arranging the rooms to our odd requirements, or service of refreshments, the staff was always ready to serve with a smile (even when our meetings sometimes stretched late into the night). A special mention must be made of Manish Kumar, associate in the banquet outlet, who looked after us during our meetings and ensured that we were able to work effectively.",5
"Good hotel, stay was pleasant, buffet was very nice.. I stayed there with my family for first time but definitely would like to stay in future if I get some good deals.  Room was very well furnished..staff was good. ",5
"Jatin, chef muneesh, sagar, chef ajitav made our stay really pleasant! I have been staying multiple spg hotels for last 15 years. This team is quite special and unparallel to any other SPG property not for its location, amenities but more for the cordial behaviour of the entire team!  Keep the flag high ! ",5
I have travelled to Gurgaon several times and have stayed in several hotels. Le Meridien is definitely my favorite hotel there. The facility is new and modern - which believe me is very much needed after a hectic day in the city. It has plenty of sun light in the room and the lobby. Great culinary experience: the main restaurant ha a wide variety of cuisines - much more than the other hotels that I have stayed in. The quality is great and staff is very friendly. Chef Gaurav Singh is specially helpful. He was very responsive to my dietary requirements.  I highly recommend this hotel,5
"I am deeply impressed and thankful for the outstanding services offered by the concierge desk particularly Aditya. He and his teammate Anuj helped me coordinate a complex pickup process when I had accidentally left my watch in the room post check-out. This team especially Aditya, Aditya's leadership, made sure that it got to me before I left the country. He has done this before, leveraging his white contacts in the industry to make sure my suitcase gets picked up. I stay in hotels globally, but I can honestly say no one can hold a candle to this kind of service. Keep up the good work. I will be coming back soon to you, bringing many foreign guests with me-again.",5
"Le Meridien Gurgaon is one of your run of the mill Business 5 star hotels. The property looks new and is well maintained. In terms of decor the rooms are nice, clean and spacious. The breakfast spread is quite nice and will more than fill your breakfast needs. The location is at the entrance of Gurgaon and quite conveniently located from the Airport.  Overall the hotel was doing quite well during my stay.   However, I was staying in early January on what was a moderately cold winter day. However, feeling cold in the room I couldn't get the air-conditioning to go above 22.5 degrees. I called the hotel reception who sent up a attendant who said nothing could be done. Then on my insistence he called the actual air conditioning technician, who after about 30mins of fiddling around",4
"It‚Äôs always a great experience to visit this property in gurugram. Starting from front desk to spa to restaurant to lounge, all staff members are amazing and a great team. Spl mention to Disha, if she‚Äôs the one you meet first then be rest assured and your experience will force you to come back to this peaceful and soothing place. Wish the standards are maintained like this across all properties in India at least. ",5
"Thank You for Accommodating my requests,  i had a pleasant stay with no discomfort, our room was so beautiful and the view from my room was amazing. Shout out to Kajal Sharma for Being an amazing host, and our Driver S. K Yadav",5
"Fantastic stay at LM Gurgaon . Entire stay was very well organized from Check in - to Check out . Associates are well groomed , energetic and smart at front desk . Food menu lavish and taste amazing .  There Staff was friendly and well courteous. Set up of all events in conference was with full of concept and innovation . I am really thankful to GM Sanjay Gupta and Shamsher (DHR) who has done amazing and tremendous efforts to make the South Asia HR Meet-2018 successful and memorable for us.",5
"I came for a conference at the hotel and the service was great. The rooms are very clean, good size, and nice amenities. They were fixing the pool and the gym was closed too, but otherwise it was great. The breakfast buffet offers western and local options, so you can¬¥t go wrong here. The location is a bit hidden, about 10 min walk to the subway.",4
"The hotel is located beautifully with a backdrop of entire city of Gurgaon. The staff offers amazing hospitality with amazing banquet spaces. The associates are always ready to provide you whatever you need. Not to forget was the personalized services by Anuradha Bisht, Amity Kapuria from Front Office and Mikhail from Banquets. ",5
The Le Meridien Gurgaon has really nice Club room suites where we stayed for a day to celebrate our 6th anniversary.  The suite was extremely spacious. The look may not be that opulent but the amenities make up for it.  Wonderful staff and courteous and timely service. Only complaint need to have water faucets in toilets sorry not used to using tissue paper.   Overall great stay at a great property.  ,5
"The staff and the service was excellent , check in was smooth and support extended was superb. The room was good from the location perspective , however was a bit crowded and need a place to place your in room dining. Location , Ambiance and facilities are great. Best feature is the positive attitude of the staff and support they extend.",4
"Extremely clean hotel. Room is quite cozy with nice decor and all the amenities - coffee maker, mini bar, TV, stylish sofa, working desk and above all, a wonderful music system.Especially, loved the bath endowed with luxurious collection of toiletries. Breathtaking views both from the room and the bath. Very cooperative staff and great service. Got me  a print out of my tickets even at midnight. A complimentary coffee is offered every evening in  the lounge area. Food is just amazing- both at the breakfast buffet and room service. Easily accessible by road or metro. Le Meridien is the ultimate luxurious paradise.",5
I was disappointed with the level of service primarily because of lack of attention to details. I had to ask for my air conditioning to be fixed a couple of times before it happened. They were still not in covering bathroom supplies like moisturiser and shampoo.  The food was decent. The rooms are starting  to look a little tacky as the light Colored carpet is stained in a few places. ,3
"Travelled to Gurgaon for business meetings and stayed at this hotel. You can have comfortable stay here, hotel is not so great or luxurious, probably compared to a higher end IBIS and doesn't come in 5 star league. Cooperative staff and clean rooms.",4
Travelled to Gurgaon on business and enjoyed four days of excellent service and good food. All of the staff took time to greet and make sure all of my needs were met. The chauffeurs were skilled and knowledgeable of the area.,5
"Everything which I expected before staying in LM Curtain, I found everything. It's a full service hotel with all the amenities and luxurious ambience.And all the staff are really very friendly and professional too.Special Thanks to Mr. Abhiuday for arranging an upgrade and many more requests of mine and friends to make my birthday a memorable one. Risabh ,vishal,abhinav from room service these all names deserved to be remembered.Thank you LM gurgaon. Keep it up",5
"Excellent property with excellent services. Chef Gaurav's special attention to my toddler's food needs was commendable. He delivered outstanding service to us each time we visited the restaurant for breakfast. Room service (Mr.Ajay) was also great & really co-operative. Overall, it was pleasure staying with Le Meridien.",5
"As I was last month stayed in le meridien, gurgaon..... As I entered to hotel the experience was wow for me. I found everyone smiling and a feeling like I'm again in home which is away from home.  Front desk team is so attentive specially Ms. Disha,  she always took extreme care of our needs. As icing on the top is executive lounge, Mr. Manish Kumar FOA. He always took extreme care of mine, always smile, greet with standards.without any doubt, as he talks alot with attractive smile I liked that. We discuss alot about Indian tradition, culture.  Well done and keep shining..... Manish Kumar.  We'll gonna meet u soon. ",5
Had a very comfortable stay. However the differentiator was the hospitality by entire staff. Icing on the cake was the super amazing hospitality and food made by Chef Gaurav. One of the best butter chicken and Lal Maas i have  ever had which was made by chef gaurav. Kuddos to the entire team.,5
Thanks to Manish from the front desk for making the stay very comfortable . Great ambience .hospitable staff . And good food to taste and suite all platter . Again A special mention to Mr Manish Kurmar,5
Had a very comfortable stay in a very nice and aptly furnished room. The hospitality right from reception was great with a nice lounge experience. The breakfast was very elaborate multi-cuisine and fulfilling. Overall a very relaxing stay.,5
We stayed in this hotel for two nights and must say that we had a wonderful experience. The resort is very well maintained with lots of greenery around. They are taking all the necessary precautions for COVID. Our room was very comfortable and had a nice view of the garden. Considering Covid restrictions and limitations their breakfast spread was also very good. Most heartening thing was to see that most of the staff members of Trident were willing to do little extra than our requirements. We will definitely visit this hotel in future also. ,5
"Celebrated by anniversary at Trident Hilton, Gurugram.  Loved the ambience, food served by chef and hospitality of the staff. Great place to relax, enjoy meal and have fun with family while maintaining distance and safety precautions. Good job Trident Hilton team!!",5
"Had a pleasant stay at the hotel, fully refreshing and relaxing working from the pool side rooms, the hotel staff is very lovely and takes good care of there guest, and now talking about the breakfast, that was the main reason i felt in love with their hospitality when i met Aviral and shreya in the breakfast area, they were both sweet and made me feel comfortable at my place by getting everything from Me right from my table, and shreya even got chocolate ice cream for me, i loved her gesture towards the guest  THUMBS up for the staff members üëçüèª",5
"By God's grace we got the chance to host my brother's wedding here in December 2020. We could not have asked for a better wedding celebration weekend during the pandemic! It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Right from the checkin till checkout, the hotel and its staff left no stone unturned in making our stay and celebrations the best experience for us and our guests. The cordial service, warm staff, F&B, everything was top notch. Special thanks to the Banquet Head Chef - Mr.Ram for serving the best food in all the meals during our stay and functions. Cheers to the hotel and all the best!",5

Beautiful hotel, delicious food, friendly and prompt staff and many other things which will make me go again to the hotel. Not to forget the hygiene protocols at the hotel makes you feel safe.",5
"Stayed at Trident Gurgaon on New Year's Eve. A comfortable stay complemented by great service. A special mention for the 31st December Trident Dinner- delightful ambience, excellent service and great food. The overall experience was made extremely special by the servicing experience offered by Prakriti. She went an extra mile by ensuring that the request for customized (non-spicy) food requests were fulfilled. Her recommendations made were in sync with our requirements making the overall experience even more memorable. Great Job!",5

"I had gone there with my family, to celebrate my mothers Birthday. We were spellbound from the time we entered the property. The resort is beautiful to say the least.   We were given an upgrade in one room to a pool view suite. The suite was amazing with a view of the pool right outside the gigantic window. Not to miss this at all! Balloons and cake was placed for my mother which was really a sweet gesture.  The staff was well trained and all the covid related infra was in place. We realy had a nice time at the property.  The only minor off was at the breakfast.. It was a little chaotic, though the buffet spread was placed at two places to spread the crowd, one of the buffets did not have the placard to depict the food item. and the toaster and bread table was only inside, which",5
"I stayed at trident for 2 nights with my family, the rooms were small and cozy, the room service was even better! I loved every bit of it. In house keeping priyanka assisted me with all my requests! She was kind enough to provide me with everything though i bothered her a multiple times to be honest! I had my daily breakfasts at oberoi 361. Oberoi people were kind enough to shift our breakfast from trident to theres! The breakfasts were so so good. Chef kashish made THE BEST RANCH EVER. I requested it to happen on the 2nd day and she did it indeed. She served us whatever we asked for; even more. Her hospitality was remarkable. Nandini also served us everything we asked for on the first day. She was a delight to talk to! The experience was so good that i would like to have there",4
"We stayed at the beautiful Trident Gurgaon for a day. Loved every moment of it! Food at Cilantro was super-delicious, hospitality completely surpassed our expectations and the hotel is stunningly beautiful. Kudos to the Trident team who took care of us right from the moment we stepped into the property - Hame, Chef Shivam and Chef Sang, Sarthak and Tarun from housekeeping. Everything was just WOWW - thanks to you guys. Would definitely visit again!   P.S. You must try their Avocado shake (recommended to us by Chef Shivam).",5
"The hotel is an amazingly beautiful property, very nicely located near airport but what stood out was the amazing hospitality and particularly food by Shivam and his colleagues - Arsh Suyal, Chef Ram, Vasu, Jivyanshi and Rishabh. They treated us like family and took care of every need and even suggested some brilliant dishes we never had before. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in gurgaon / near airport.",5
We had a lovely stay and got a beautiful room . The staff was very efficient and dedicated . Mehak made sure that we had a comfortable stay and did everything to make that happen . Thankyou for the lovely hospitality. ,5
"I stayed at Trident Gurgaon for a leisure trip. The hotel location, infrastructure, food, and staff is excellent. Staff really goes extra way to make the stay comfortable. Special thanks to Prakriti and Jassi at restaurant for the special treatment. Must recommended hotel with beautiful ambience and infrastructure.",5
Had a very comfortable stay with my 8yr old child and 1year toddler .Extensive Covid safety and hygiene measures in place.They have dedicated duty managers in place to ensure the Covid safety and sanitisation measures are properly implemented.,5
"It was an awesome experience with staff so warm and friendly, special thanks to Tamana. Trident gave us full flexibility to shoot anywhere with no restrictions.  They have so many locations and all of them are stunning. They even provided us with a room, so beautifully decorated and offcourse so cosy. Thank you so much for hosting us like your own family.",5
This place we chose for the birthday celebration was so apt. Our stay at Trident (Oasis in Gurgaon)was truly a treat filled with all the beautiful things around. The view from the pool facing room was too serene. Thanks to Divya at Front Desk for this. Food served at Cilantro by amazing Chef Ankur was very very delicious. Special thanks to Nitin and Dhrishti for their wonderful hospitality. From candle light dinner to the welcome drinks and cake.. every thing done by them was overwhelming.,5
Words are less to praise for Chaitanya Prakriti Manish Sudesh Alok  Beautiful hotel nearby delhi with excellent staff and services.  Location of the room was perfect.  Prices are quite reasonable too.  Will visit again soon.,5
"When I travel for business I generally stay at nice hotels. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and make no mistake, the landscaped grounds with water features and jasmine trees makes the back drop of this Moghul architecture enchanting. But this is all secondary to the wonder that is the Trident.  What I didn't expect when checking into my hotel for my 17 day business trip was to find a 2nd home. People are responsible for that. The staff at the Trident made my stay not only effortless, but special. When faced with opportunities to go to breakfast or dinner outside of the hotel I always deferred because I knew I would be taken care of in the most caring and professional way possible. When learning more about the Trident and Oberoi I learned that the interview about 6000",5
"The food and service are ultimate specially staffs are very friendly and kind the whole property maintains neet and clean.Special mentions to Chef Ram, Chef Gaurav, Prakriti and Monu and entire food and beverages team.",5

"Well I can say my decision for staycation to spend anniversary at Trident was right & the hotel made sincere effort to make it memorable. Its a great property with wide open space & water bodies.  Staff is very courteous & hospitable. Little surprises in between made my day & I don't like to ruin it for future customers by divulging details. Due to Covid restrictions only Cilantro restaurant was operational and f&b staff took extra effort in making dinner a gastronomic delight. Thai green curry was amazing & dessert was complimentary.  Special call out to - Vasu, Shivam, chef Ram, chef Sang, Gurleen, Manish, Arsh, Nicodim, Gagan & Pratiksha.   Keep up the good work & yeahh breakfast was good too !",5
"Excellent hospitality and lovely place, one of the few great hotels in Delhi / NCR with such a royal touch to it. Great service and great staff! Special mention to Monu at Cilantro restaurant for such a great experience and taking care of all our requests. Highly recommend it.",5
Wonderful property to visit with family for a quick getaway. Open green spaces and water bodies add to freshness and keep you relaxed. Had few minor housekeeping issues during check-in however Manpreet from their team handled everything very well to make sure we were comfortable considering that due to Covid restrictions they are not working in full capacity and with only limited staff. Breakfast buffet is good. Staff overall is very helpful and courteous. Due to covid restrictions the swimming pool is not open but it's ok. Shall visit again.,4
"Loved the hospitality. Superb host Vishesh. And excellent Indian deserts by Chef Dhapedaar.  Coming back soon for the being ur guest.  The best part was the fact that they didn't say NO to anything.

We did our 1st anniversary function with them and we are extremely happy and satisfied with the food and service we got during the event. Everything was according to what was discussed and instructions given to them.,5
I hosted my sisters wedding at Trident Gurgaon. The entire event from the time I first contacted the hotel to event contracting to final management and completion of the event was handled extremely well by the management and staff. The food was also of very high quality and appreciated by all guests. The kind of safety precautions taken by the hotel considering the covid situation were also of very high standards. Overall it was an exceptional experience and I would recommend Trident very strongly for events and functions like weddings.,5

The hotel staff was extremely helpful and courteous and they made sure that all our needs were fulfilled. Despite the shoot getting stretched for more than 1 hour, the entire staff was cooperative. A perfect location for pre-wedding shoot or to host marriage functions. Special mention to Tamanna Nangia and Pratiksha Malik, who assisted us and made sure all our needs were met with one day in advance.",5
"Visited Trident Gurgaon's premier offering Cilantro during the Christmas season last year and boy what an experience I had. Right from the service quality to the ambience and the friendly staff  the experience was full filling in every sense. I decided to visit Trident Gurgaon for I had heard about the sublime dining experience that Cilantro provides, and I was not disappointed. The range of cuisines is un-matched in my opinion. I was recommended the Miso Soup by the staff and I have been since then recommending the same to others. The Kesari Phirnee offered by the restaurant needs to be classified not as food but as a short trip to heaven. It was a sublime experience and not to forget the beautifully decorated surroundings help you enjoy the season in the best way possible.",5
"The moment I entered the hotel I was mesmerised by the architecture; The beautiful water bodies and sky touching dome. I visited the hotel for one night stay and it felt like I‚Äôm at home. The staff at the hotel is welcoming and exceptional and always ready to help. Saffron, The Indian Restaurant is a must try for Indian food lovers. The breakfast buffet at cilantro had variety of options.  I would love to thank Rakhi and Jagjit for every help they extended to me during my short stay.  If you are Single lady traveller, Trident Gurgaon is the safest place to stay.",5
"Being a former hospitality student, I am very selective when it comes to chosing a  new place to dine out. I happened to visit this particular restaurant to celebrate parents' anniversary based on some reviews I had heard. And trust me, the restaurant is worth the visit.  Right from an amazing decor to amazing food and equally amazing service, everything just added on to that special day for both my parents' and I.  Will definitely recommend this place to everyone!",5
"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for a night and enjoyed our stay a lot. Hotel is primarily located which gave ease of travelling within gurgaon. The rooms are spacious and are equipped with all world class amenities. One can also enjoy a vast expanse of breakfast with lot many choices in continental and Indian Cuisine. Don't miss to book your room with splendid view of green lush garden. The best part is that you don't have to climb to many floors to reach your room , rooms are spread between 2 floors which makes your stay more seamless & time saving . Staff is very courteous and helpul and will always be present proactively to assist you at all times.   Soon be visiting again.",4

"Terrible Trident Gurgaon of (Oberoi group) this is not done and didn‚Äôt even expected such kind of eye wash from you guys. This is COMPLETE FAKENESS, FALSE HOPE AND TERIBLE DEALING WITH THE CUTOMERS.   Today is 17th September, 2020. I got a call from one of an executive in the morning saying that mr. Akshay you will be shifted to the Oberoi hotel of (the Oberoi group) due to some COVID reasons trident Gurgaon is not operational.   But here‚Äôs the thing from past 1 month I was seeking this property on every travel portal like booking.com, mmt, trivago, trip adviser etc. and no one says that this property is temporarily closed. So I called the reservation department of the Oberoi group. They quoted me the some price and I agreed to pay that amount for 1 night at trident Gurgaon.   I",1
Ingenuity can be felt upon entering the premises. The bar has a splendid atmosphere and sets the perfect vibe for appeasing meetings. The bar also offers a plethora of invigorating beverages. Highly convivial staff also makes your time more pleasurable.  P.S - Having a hot cup of Latte Macchiato complemented with scrumptious cookies and watching Robert Lewandowski score a goal for Bayern Munich in the first 10 minutes is the best feeling ever!!,5
I was mesmerized by the amazing ambience of Trident Gurgaon. The food was superbly delicious and the decor was out of this world. I will never forget the hospitality and the staff that added significantly to my experience and made it so delightful. Strongly recommend anyone coming over to NCR to experience Trident Gurgaon.,5
Got a chance to stay in this beautiful property for a small get together with friends and I must say I am in love with their services as Oberoi has always been know for their standards.

"My trip to Delhi was excruciating! Amidst the cacophony of the city this place felt very worm. With all it's shimmers and shine, it was the staff members who were very humane, and that's what I feel  gives the hotel it's reputation, more than anything! Thank you Team Trident Gurgaon",5
"This review is specifically for the assets the hotel holds by having people like Ms. Jaskiran (assistant). She is a wonderful guide and a reliable lady. She, in the heat of september and the time of covid, when the hotel is not functioning, heard to our request for having a tour of the property. Not only she allowed us but escorted us all along. She is a person to rely on for out of the way help. Lovely lady and an asset to the hotel. Kudos ",5
"I visited Trident Gurgaon in the month of June to attend the wedding. I must say it is one of the most beautiful hotels I have seen. It's built like a resort hence doesn't feel to be a city hotel. Also the service was impeccable. Great Ambience, Great architecture and great service",5
"I visited Saffron with a couple of friends to celebrate a birthday. We had an amazing experience, the food was delicious, ambience was calming and the staff were very accommodating to any request we had! I will surely recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for authentic mouth watering Indian food!",5
A beautiful property and the hospitality is just amazing.  Rooms are comfortable and the food is great. The breakfast spread is one of the best I have come across.  A must visit for a staycation or even a meeting.,5
"It was my mum‚Äôs birthday in March, and we decided to head to Cilantro for their brunch. I made reservations in the morning, and they offered to present a cake to my mother after our lunch. Most restaurants do that if you inform them in advance, but still, it was sweet! Mehak from Front Office escorted us to the restaurant when we entered the hotel; she was extremely pleasant and gracious to talk to. Food was good, but the service was great. Our server was warm and engaging, and most importantly, attentive. My mum had a lovely time, which is what matters in the end. So would definitely return to Cilantro in the future!",5
"Stayed at the hotel during the month of March before the Covid engulfed us and restricted all.  I must compliment a wonderful and a memorable experienceat the hotel. An excellent hospitality rendered by the team of hardworking and courteous professionals.  A special thanks for Pratiksha and her team to ensure  that we had an amazing time at your holistic destination. To make our special moment more memorable.

"Thank you for the wonderful stay we really enjoyed it. Comfortable rooms and amazing food.   Himanshu, Afzal, Jaskiran and Pratiksha were very helpful . Trident made my special occasion memorable. Thanks to the wonderful team",5
"I‚Äôve been a regular guest to Trident Gurgaon now, I must say the hotel is the best hotel in terms of service so far. I would like to mention a few employees Afzal and Pratiksha at their best!! Super work.",5
"I stayed at the hotel with my family and it was no less than home away from home.  The food, staff, landscape of the hotel are just amazing. Every employee tries to put their 100% to make sure that guest‚Äôs stay is comfortable. My overall experience was awesome!",5
"Stayed in this marvelous hotel to attend a close family member's wedding and I was overwhelmed with the experience.  Starting with the most important factor- safety. Not only they took all the precautions for hygiene and sanitation, but also they went a step ahead and made every interaction utmost safe. They have successfully adapted to the new normal I must say. The room was excellent with remarkable facilities and the food especially breakfast was top notch. The entire wedding event was well managed by Mr. Ishan  who went an extra mile to ensure we had everything that we needed before we could ask for it. All other staff members were highly courteous,  well trained and treated us like a family. They have set a benchmark on how a wedding event should be curated in times like",5
"I happened to be at Trident,Gurgaon in the beginning of March to have dinner with my friends. And the food was amazing and feast to the taste buds. Undoubtedly beautiful property with even attentive and caring staff. I Still remember, how they had made efforts to ensure the safety and security of their guests even when the pandemic was in its initial phase,by measuring body temperature and placing hand sanitizer  everywhere. Looking forward to be visiting to this place soon to stay & add more fond memories.",5
We had a short and wonderful stay at Trident. The food was excellent and the hospitality was very warm It is worth mentioning was the kind hospitality of a young management trainee called Prakriti who used to interact with us everyday during our breakfast visit to the restaurant. In a couple of meetings she has understood our taste and brought us exactly which made each one of us happy. Talented girl like her who is sensitive to customer needs should be appreciated.,5
"So my review has been a long time coming but one I must post because if I were to describe the Trident Gurgaon in one word , it would be Home ! As a mom of two very young kids and staying far away from friends and family we have no help as a couple. And often it can take its toll. So a few years ago my husband proposed a ‚Äòstaycation‚Äô - short vacation in an alternate, fully serviced location away from Home. Just for two nights , twice a year. So I could unwind, rejuvenate and just enjoy some solitude. While the plan was always to pick a different hotel, after my very first staycation at the Trident, I never went anywhere else! It‚Äôs calm oasis in the middle of the city makes you believe you‚Äôre in a distant far away land , free from snarls of traffic, and the hardships of whatever",5
"Hadn‚Äôt stayed at Trident Gurgaon since 2018 and didn‚Äôt write a review last time because standards had dropped and I strongly believe it was due to the general manager (Amitabh?).Staff seemed to be on edge , service wasn‚Äôt as expected. Thought we‚Äôd give it a try again. I‚Äôm delighted we did. Normal service has been resumed ( New manager.. Amit?).Five  of us spent a week recently. Excellent service/rooms/food. Staff are smiling again and make you feel at home. Keep it up  Highly recommended  ",5
"Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. I would like to thank miss Jaskiran for making my stay so comfortable.",5
"Had Super amazing stay.we had a super amazing holi at trident.. very friendly, helpful staff With very quick service. Very near to mall and airport. Thanks to Vatsalya Mehrotra managing everything so well. Everyone in the family had a gala time at with wonderful nicely maintained property.",5
A wonderful experience just before the outbreak of Corona virus we got our time of our lives where the property is excellent the staff specifically vatslya Mehrotra  was a superb host while made our stay comfortable and overwhelming in all aspects be it the stay the room service the food and the attentiveness from the hotel staff just amazing  not only I highly recommend but I will make sure to visit trident many times again...I thank u alot team trident,5
"We were on a trip to India with several internal travel and events planned. However, due to COVID-19, we canceled those trips and extended our ""home-like"" stay at the Trident for almost the entire week!  There, we invited local friends over for impromptu get togethers in a clean, safe environment. The hotel staff were phenomenal -- that includes hotel entrance team, bell boys, reception area, Cilantro restaurant crew (miss that great food!), housekeeping, laundry service, spa treatment, just to name a few departments.  Their awareness of the situation and guest care was excellent -- all around the property. I thank everyone at Trident to make my wife's, my daughter's, and my stay there a highlight of our trip. Take care everyone there and see see you soon!",5
It was such a wonderful weekend we spent at the Trident Gurgaon last month. The staff especially is extremely hospitable and courteous. They take special interest in you and in making your stay as wonderful as possible. Spent an incredible 2 days at this beautiful property and it was made a lot more special by the staff where I'd specially like to mention Rishabh and all the arrangements and efforts made by Vatsalya and Vibhuti. Thank you Trident for an unforgettable experience and memories I shall cherish for a very long time.,5
"They have quite big array of menu, good aroma and punctual service. Staff behaviour is exceptional and Mr. Gaurav who assist our table is very helpfull and approchable and having good knowledge on food.",5
"We stayed at the Trident for our last night after a 2 week tour of India. Prior to our arrival at the Trident , fears of covid 19 escalated and second flight to get home was cancelled. We could not contact the airline to get another flight. The concierge desk at the Trident went above and beyond and managed to get American Airlines on the phone! Alok Rai knew we had a tough day and was so kind and patient with us. He persevered until we were confirmed on another flight home.  We also were well cared for by the waiters. After the tough day we had the waiter Guavar (?spelling?) also went above and beyond to meet our needs.      These are trying times to have been so far from home and the staff at this hotel provided a nurturing sanctuary for us. I will always be grateful for the",5
"The coronavirus scare ruined our planned babymoon vacation to Bali and we were extremely deflated. I wasnt sure if we could plan a stay at any hotel even locally, for lack of sufficient precautions. But Trident really assured us about the best precautions taken by them- checking each guest's temperature and getting declaration forms signed of travel history and also conforming that no tourist from the affected countries were staying with them. We took a leap of faith and went with it.  The hospitality started pouring in from the moment we checked in, with a lovely cake and a congratulations banner set out to welcome us, on day two we were given potpourri with a sweet message and on holi, we were given a ganesha idol with lots of good wishes. I was overwhelmed by the gesture.  ",5
My family and I had a very pleasant stay at the Trident. The property is very beautiful and is spread across a huge area. The staff was very polite and humble. The location is great. The view from the room was amazing.,5
"The lanscaping, food, decor, staff and ambiance are unbeatable.  Our room felt as if we were floating on water when we opened our blinds.  We have stayed here on several occasions in the past, and standards are identical, a truly magnificent hotel.",5
"I stayed at the hotel due to my visit to Delhi for work. Upon arrival, check in was an easy process and my room was ready despite arriving early. The hotel is beautiful and definitely 5 star. The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you. They are all really welcoming and will always ask how you are etc. The room is clean and spacious. Really comfortable bed and pillows. They offer a complimentary car service to ambiance mall which I used several times. The service was excellent. The only thing that was missing was that the room didn‚Äôt have menus and prices for the restaurants- I had to keep going into the hotel website to access the menus but they weren‚Äôt up to date. It would have been nice to see the menu and prices before going to the restaurant. Other than that I would definitely",5
"The service at this hotel is really top notch, a lot of service making you feel being taken care of in a personal yet not intrusive way. Very polite and respectful staff. The restaurang itself is worth visit. Rooms are very comfortable as well.  During the stay, we have been touched by small personal gifts and services from different staff members. Excellent place in any respect!!!  I hope they will be able to maintain this level, there are not many places like this one.",5
Naman showed me some great warm up and cool down routines. These will help me regain flexibility. I have had a few injuries lately and need to find ways to avoid these.  Really great attention to detail and my capabilities.  Thanks so much Naman. I hope to come back someday to get more fitness wisdom.  Ian Gillies,5
"Despite of it being my 3rd visit to Cilantro , I enjoyed my meal and the ambience like it was my 1st. Ms. Prakriti, Mr. Gaurav along with the whole team made us feel so comfortable and pampered us by their extraordinary and exemplary politeness showing true professionalism. Each and every item from the buffet was sumptuous and finger licking but our personal favourite and highly recommended was the wok tossed noodles and Badam halwa.  You all must visit!  Kudos to trident ",5
"Had a lovely stay, lovely food, stayed there for 2 nights. The staff treated us like we were guests of honor. The facilities were great. Check in and check out was easy. I would reccomend to anybody coming to New Delhi to stay there as India is a very overwhelming place and the hotel gave us a break from the hussle, bussle and traffic.",5
Definite 5 stars! The staff were so accomodating & kind. The premises are stunning & kept pristine clean & beautifully taken care of. Would highly recommend staying here. My friend & I have definitely enjoyed our short stay here,5

A very well maintained Boutique property. Well crafted luxurious rooms and morden amenities. The lavish spread at cilantro is something u can look forward to kick start your morning. Their speciality restaurant The Kanomi is well know for the suthentic Sushi. Saffron the Thali restaurent never disappoints and the live music in the evening adds a romantic aura. In total truely worth it. ,5
"After reading all the fantastic reviews for Cilantro, I headed there for a buffet lunch with my husband on my birthday. I had previously planned to go there at least five other times but had to cancel my bookings due to some reason or the other. So this much awaited visit happened, and must say, happened for good. At the very outset, a warm staff willing to go out of the way to make you comfortable needs a special mention. Pratiksha, Nikhil, Sachin, and every other staff member who waited on us or helped us with deciding what to have, were extremely polite and welcoming. The ambience and the fact that it was comparatively less crowded was icing on the cake. That reminds me, the point of contact, who had reserved the table for us, was sweet enough to bring a very fresh, creamy,",5
"This is a beautiful and peaceful property. If u want a break from hustle-bustle of Delhi /NCR, you can stay here. Not much people here. Staff was extremely helpful from the entrance gate.  Staff stands apart from greet to the help offered. Amazing !!!! These guys are doing their job really well. From entrance to every door to restaurant to pool to gym. Staff is helpful.  Check in was very smooth. You will be checked for cronovirus as precaution at entrance. Hand sanitizers available at checkin and in gym !  Welcome drink was offered at time of check in.  Room with pool view was very good.  Pool was also good.  Gym was also good.  Breakfast was good too (paneer parantha and orange juice) . Staff was taking care of everything. Special thanks to Rubin ( breakfast restaurant staff",5
"I had the pleasure of staying here for 3 weeks whilst on a business trip. It's epic! After a day in the office the pool, food, staff ... all brilliant! The low, villa style layout is beautfully designed and a joy to stay in compared to the usual high rise hotels. It's a bit of a calm oasis in amongst a busy, dusty business city. Thanks!",5
Dear Prakriti - thank you for your kind hospitality and taking good care of all of us during lunch today. You displayed true customer centric approach and ensured each and everyone on the table was well taken care.  It is thanks to team members like you that make a great place. More power to you and wish you good luck. ,5
"This property is absolutely beautiful, both inside and out. The food is great, the staff go over and above to provide great service, and yet it is not stuffy or pretentious. It is also impeccably clean and it is 100% solar powered..  There is a pool, gymn, meeting rooms, on-site restaurants, pretty well all of the bells and whistles one would expect from a property like this.",5
All I can say is WOW. What a beautiful hotel and amazing staff and service. The staff are so helpful and friendly. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in and will definitely will be coming again. ,5
Quite a surprise to find this oasis in the urban Gurgaon jungle. Low built domed roofs and shining water expanses reflecting off Prussian blue tiles. The rooms are near perfect. I stayed in the Presidential suite which was palatial.  Applause for the bathrooms the fittings and a very comfortable bed.  And a warning about breakfast: you are sure to overeat. I did.  The staff was the epitome of good service. Brilliant. I could get used to this! ,5
"If you have lost yourself in the hustle bustle of Delhi NCR, Trident Gurgaon is the place to head to! I assure you, you will find your soul! It is a serene oasis in the middle of all the chaos. I went to The Bar in Trident Gurgaon for a few drinks with my friends. I have recently started exploring five star properties in Delhi NCR for the unique experience. Trident Gurgaon has definitely been the best start to my journey. The staff is very welcoming, warm and genuine! From the doorman at the entrance to the staff at the lobby and at the bar, everyone made me feel very importaby. Keep up the excellent service!",5
Thank you for great and fantastic time. Everything is great for us to stay there.  Restaurant is very comfortable and food is very good. We want to stay Hotel once again.  Wonderful staff and wonderful place!! ,5
"We have been coming to Delhi for years but tried this hotel for the first time and then wondered what took us this long to come here. It was such a pleasure to stay here. The team is out there to do anything to make you feel welcomed and especially Inder, he had been such a nice boy. From the time of checking us in to meeting us everyday, ensuring we are  comfortable. He is truly an asset. Amandeep at the porch was so pleasant everytime we passed by, he was there wishing us. Please give our regards to both these gems for making us feel special. We would love to come back!!",5
"One of the most beautiful & maitained properties in Gurgaon. Food quality and presentation, along with service was great. Tried different types of dim sum, they were out of this world. Edwardian era ambience is enhanced by excellent landscape. Keep up the good work !! Highly recommended.",5
"What impressed us most was the happy staff, they were most helpful, going out of their way to assist us. From the Concierge arranging a last minute visit to Chandni Chowk on a Saturday afternoon to gifts of ear rings on our last morning from Prakriti in the Cilantro.  The surroundings are well maintained, calm and the amenities excellent. It was an oasis from the outside, the traffic is brutal as mentioned, but on our return, the welcome is delightful.  The food selection was excellent as was the quantity.",5
"Mostly single store building arrangement, so most rooms are on ground level. Rooms are very spacious and luxurious, as expected from a five star hotel. Personal extremely polite and offering help. Fantastic breakfast in a nice grand hall.",4
"Beautiful grounds and excellent quiet rooms.   Good security and a very helpful staff makes this a great place to stay.  The lounge was suprisingly modern and the service was a bit slow.  The resteraunt was good as it offered a nice variety of food options.  This would be a great hotel for business travelers, but it is not what most of us would consider an airport hotel.  Allow a good 45 minutes to an hour to get to the airport.  Traffic is brutal.",5

"A friend of my wife had gifted a baking class followed by lunch at Trident, for her birthday. He put us in touch with Chef Saikat Sairat and he was super flexible with the dates we could go on. In fact, I had to reschedule on the last minute and he happily did so. On the day of our visit, we were cordially greeted by him and the other staff. He enthusiastically gave us a tour of the Trident kitchen, made us try some super awesome chocolate he had made the day before and taught us how to make banana walnut cake. He explained every tiny detail with interest and wrote a recipe for us. In the end of the class, he also packed a loaf of the cake.   It was followed by the perfect lunch we could ask for. He kept checking on us every now and then. Not just him, the entire staff was",5
"I stayed two days at the Trident in Gurgaon for business and it was absolutely wonderful.  The level of service was top notch, food and bar were spectacular, and the grounds were an absolute oasis in the city.  Calm, peaceful, fantastic.  It is attached to it's even nicer sister hotel, the Oberoi.  They have a more upscale restaurant and a cool piano bar.",5
"Maam,   My Sincere thanks for taking much care during our 9 days stay at Trident. From upgrading my room to Foods; laundry & car rental ‚Äì everything was just exceptional.

We have plans to visit Bali during our 25th Anniversary coming April with my family also.   There is no doubt the hospitality is World No 1 & I can better describe this as because",5
"We were moved to the Trident after another five star hotel let us down - how lucky we were!  It is a peaceful lush paradise inside the walls, the rooms are so comfy, clean and luxurious; there is a spa, quiet pool area and well equipped fitness centre; the food is varied and delicious with three different restaurants and a couple of bars.  The atmosphere is tranquil despite being by one of Delhi's busy roads, which you can barely hear at all.  It is easy to get in and out of the city - an uber cost us about 5GBP one way.  We never once felt out of place here, the staff are all endlessly courteous, friendly and helpful.  Particularly helpful was Mohit who greeted us with a smile and good conversation every day, and also had a great photographic eye, he knows all the best places",5
"The hotel is extremely well run in a calm manner  There is a sense of service instilled naturally to the staff and a wonderful feeling to be there   The F&B is definitely well taken care of  The hotel retains that charm of service hospitality and taste , that is being lost in most rub of the mill hotels happening now a days There is a sense in what they do and prepare , that‚Äôs what matters the signature is what makes you feel the thing ...

"Hi,    We are writing this mail to express our appreciation for the quality of services you offered us for a one day stay in your hotel. We chose to stay with Trident to celebrate our 1st Wedding Anniversary and were very pleased with your excellent hospitality which surpassed all our expectations. The room was impeccably clean and all the facilities were in perfect working order. All the arrangements including decorating the room with flowers, balloons, cakes etc made by Vatsalya Mehrotra were perfect and in accordance to our instructions.

We stayed in this Hotel in January.I put in mail while reservation that it‚Äôs my Husband‚Äôs Birthday and our Anniversary so would like a cake in the room.Prompt came the reply from Ms.Diyasha Das confirming the same.To our surprise when we reached the hotel not only were we upgraded to the presidential suite but our room was decorated with balloons and flowers(WITHOUT EVEN ASKING)and of course we got our special cake.We could not thank  the hotel staff enough for the amazing hospitality.Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out.Highly recommend this hotel for stay and romantic getaways.........it‚Äôs so quiet & peaceful inside you will totally forget that you are in Gurgaon.,5
"We had the Sunday Brunch at Cilantro today (Jan 19, 2020) and the experience was quite under whelming.   The food & beverage team here along with the chefs state that even the food on display is not part of the Sunday Brunch, then one really wonders at the culture at this property. We were initially denied a pasta dish on display by a chef informing us that it was not a part of the Sunday Brunch. Other chains like the Taj & ITC offer guests choices even though they are not on display.   Since we‚Äôre fond of dim sums and enquired on whether they could be served, the answer is again a flat NO. This is generally not the way the Trident brand positions itself, but it‚Äôs a dynamic world and I presume the Trident is also evolving, but definitely not for the better.   The spread was very",1
The hotel has an amazing architecture with multiple artificial small lakes that provide scenic reflection of the buildings. The staff is extremely courteous and serve the needs of the customer promptly.,5
"Well the brand does matter......and trident being a excellent hotel has no flaws....the food, services and people are all warm.....hospitaible.... Keep doing the same work. I travelled after a long time to gurgaon..this hotel is near to delhi and has very high standards....buffet is excellent and tasty food.",5
"Forgot the name but I guess it was Avanti the manager and roshni who were amazing. They paid attention to the finest details. Had embroidered names of all of us in the family, on the towels, plates had kids names with cookies and the overall welcome was amazing. They also had the food prepared for us to take away at 2 am in the morning which was just over the top. I‚Äôll definitely consider staying here next time I visit delhi and will also recommend it to my friends. Thanks for the thoughtful hospitality.",5
"We had the pleasure of spending our first two nights ever in India at the Trident Gurgaon in New Delhi, prior to beginning a tour with Insight Luxury Gold Vacations.  The hotel room was grand, well appointed, the service was fantastic and the food in the Cilantro Restaurant was excellent.  The restaurant staff were outstanding and remembered our names and preferences.  All we could think was it was amazing. Prakriti and Angel were so great in the restaurant as was Siddhartha at reception.  In fact,  every employee at the hotel could not do enough to meet our needs as they went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable.  They provided complimentary car service to the nearby Ambiance Mall, daily newspapers, bottled water, robes and slippers..... you name it, they provide it.  We",5

However, the Complimentary breakfast is reasonable but has lot of scope for improvement and offer better choices.",4
"The property is beautiful and restful. The staff is pleasant and courteous, with prompt service. We had a great experience. The rooms are comfortable and spacious with a view to the garden. Restaurants are great with good food.",5
"We have been a regular tenant at Trident Gurgaon. We visit India about once every two years and go straight from the airport to Trident and on our way back spend a couple of days at the hotel before seeing family and visiting other parts of the country. We have settled on Trident having tried several other hotels in and around Delhi.   The signature aspect of the hotel is its architecture. It‚Äôs hard to believe that these Moroccan domes and pools are nestled in one of the busiest metropolis in the world. The calm that the setting creates is exactly what you want before you visit the craziness that India can be, or leave it for a long journey back home.   We are amazed each time with the level of service and attentiveness of the staff. We don‚Äôt feel anonymous at all as it seems",5
"This was our first time at the Trident in Gurgaon. We chose it because of the hotel‚Äôs proximity to South Delhi. It turned out to be an excellent experience. The property itself is beautiful and restful and the staff and service is excellent. Everyone, from the front desk to the restaurants to housekeeping to bell men, is eager to ensure that you have a great experience. The rooms are well appointed and most comfortable and the breakfast is sumptuous. Highly recommended and we can‚Äôt wait to go back again. ",5
"I had the pleasure of staying at the Trident Gurgaon for three nights and found the hotel top-notch in every respect. The service was friendly and attentive, the food delicious, and the hotel staff thoroughly professional. The quality of treatment here absolutely sets the standard for other hotels, regardless of location‚Äîand I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased!",5
We visited this hotel multiple times. But we came back after a long time and had lunch Buffett at cilantro. The food quality and the variety is excellent combined with commendable service from both Rishabh and Rabin. We really liked the service!,5
We stayed here for two nights for our daughter's marriage. We were extremely happy with the quality of food and services provided to us during our stay and for the wedding events.Lots of open green area in this hotel makes it a great venue for weddings and other events without disturbing the in house guests. Our special thanks to Mr Amit jain for his great services.,5
My wife and I decided to ring in her birthday at this property. We were seeking a comfortable accommodation which is well located and offers a retreat like experience without requiring one to travel far away from Delhi/Gurgaon. For the next 3 days we had completely forgotten that we are in a bustling metropolis and that can be attributed to the design of the property which literally cocoons its guests.  The hospitality is exemplary (as one's come to expect from the Oberoi and Trident chains). The hotel staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Great options for dining with Saffron being an excellent choice for those who'd like to experience Indian cuisine.,5
Visited the Trident Oberoi for their Sunday Brunch. Both the food and staff were excellent. There was a lot of variety and the service was quick and efficient. Would like to give a special shout-out to Udai Handa,5

Also talking about the staff is really warm and friendly, they will listen to you with full attention and also have keen observation into the conversation.  Thank you for an amazing experience Trident.  It is must visit place. Looking forward for another shot of coffee.",5
"The Trident, Gurgaon is the pinnacle of luxury. I‚Äôve stayed at this hotel on and off for many years and it‚Äôs amazing how the quality of service never diminishes. The staff are amazing and very professional in their approach to delivering a unique hospitality experience. I was pampered by everyone, especially by Mohit who could remember my room number when I could not!  Not bad considering there are hundreds of guests at any one time.   My room overlooked the pool and was very comfortable. Everything was just perfect understated luxury. The bathroom pristine, the bed heavenly and the quality of the linen and towels top notch!  But what made staying here even more special is that you‚Äôre totally cocooned from the madness that is Delhi.   On my first night I ate at their signature",5
"The Trident Gurgaon is idyllic, especially considering the infamous pollution of Delhi and Gurgaon. It is a retreat, peaceful and beautiful. Even some friends who stopped by to meet us for a coffee remarked on it. Overall minimalistic ambience is pleasing. The rooms overlook their waterscape. Waking up to that is soothing to the eyes. But what brings tears to my eyes is how much the staff bend backwards and forwards to make their guests comfortable. Nowhere in the world for this money would you get service that matches the hospitality you witness at Indian five-star hotels. In three weeks we stayed here three times. The food (breakfast) is excellent, and you have a choice of restaurants for dinner, plus an elegant bar. Convenient to get to from Indira Gandhi International",5
We stayed for two nights before leaving for Varanasi.  We had flown in from London Heathrow and we‚Äôre tired when we arrived. So it was lovely to get a early check in and a upgrade to a pool view room.  The staff are the hotels best asset every single one of them were superb and really couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.  We booked massages in the spa to help us relax after the flight and they were superb. After our massages we were so relaxed we ordered some room service which was swift and tasty.  After a good night sleep in the very comfortable be we had a delicious breakfast. Again the staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful preparing everything just as you like it.  The hotel was very clean the pool area very relaxing. The room was comfortable with a wonderfully powerful shower.  We ate in,5

On this trip we saw a pair of spot billed Ducks cleaning themselves in the water feature. Gorgeous! Cilantro has an awesome breakfast spread.",5
"After a rather tiring trip from London via Dubai we arrived at the Trident Gurgaon.  Once rested, we went for dinner at their Saffron Restaurant.  It was an amazing experience of food and flavours. The staff, especially Vivek, went out of their way to make our experience exceptional.  All in all, a splendid welcome to India.",5
"I was amazed at the elegance of this hotel but what blew me away was the attention by each and every single one of the staff. From the first person to the last one I saw, they were very welcoming, and wanting to make sure you enjoyed your stay. I was amazed that the executive chef personally spent time each morning in the dining greeting and helping ensure that my stay was good I absolutely love this place and will be coming here next year when I come back to India.

"I‚Äôve been to trident a few times now and the property is great. Excellent staff and amazing food. Try a fitness class with Naman at Trident and it‚Äôs amazing - very professional and skilled in his field.

It‚Äôs an excellent property with absolutely lovely staff . The attention to detail to each corner of this place is mind blowing . Our room had a view  as per the pictures below .

I thought enjoyed my stay here as it was my first time on this property   Recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in delhi . The swimming pool is delightful and the food is awesome  ,4
I stayed at the Trident in Gurgaon for 2.5 weeks. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. The staff is extremely attentive and helpful. I‚Äôve stayed at plenty hotels all around the world but the service I received definitely was one of the best.   Few tips: - Guests can attend yoga daily at the Oberoi hotel next door  - do not forget to take advantage of the Trident Spa! The best massages!  - the hotel can arrange for sightseeing trips with a guide - hotel drivers are always available to take you anywhere you might need to go in a very nice and comfortable car with WiFi !,5

"I traveled to India for business and stayed at Trident, Gurgaon for three weeks. This is hands down the best hotel and hotel staff I have encountered.  From housekeeping, to the restaurant staff, the spa staff, and front desk and management, all staff is amazing, very responsive and warm. They treated me like family. I worked nights when I was there and spent a fair bit of time interacting with staff. Each day I rose and looked forward to my interactions with them.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and well kept. Tarun-the housekeeper was there most consistently was warm and engaging and took extra steps to make sure I had everything I needed. Prakriti & Sawali in the restaurant brought me grog tea when I got a cold and helped me get well. Akash, Samir, Divi, Sawali, Sakait,",5
"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff at the airport and hotel. The staff here are extremely friendly, very considerate and they all have such warm personality. I was travelling with my husband and 3 month old daughter(wasn‚Äôt easy). They have been so flexible with everything and went above and beyond to make sure we have a pleasant stay with them.  We stayed at the hotel for 30 days as my husband was on a business trip. My first thoughts were how am I going to survive with an infant at the hotel outside of my comfort zone. But to be honest, this was home away from home, more comfortable and felt part of an extended family. The service they provide is so genuine and straight from the heart.   The atmosphere is so",5
"I stayed in Trident on a business trip. The overall experience was great, however, the best thing about Trident is the staff. Everyone made sure that during my long stay I could feel as comfortable as possible. That included customising my restaurant orders, preparing off-the-menu dishes, little gifts from room service etc. I would like to thank everyone for making my stay unforgettable: Kitchen: Saikat (fantastic chef!), Prakriti, Vivek, Angel, Vishwajeet, Alisha, Sawali and many more Spa: Naman and the team Room service: Radha and the team and many more who made a great effort",5

And for a first timer in the country,  the staffs are so friendly and helpful to make me feel assured and relaxed.

It was strongly recommended by colleague and I had a wonderful experience with the stay.  Thanks to Naman who helped me with my heavy luggage.  They offered the wash and fresh up before leaving for airport in the late night! How sweet it is!,5
"I spent 12 days at the Trident and I miss it already! I was in town for work and this hotel and staff made the couple weeks away not just tolerable but actually quite decadent. The level of service is absolutely unparalleled. Everyone takes such pride in their work and it shows. They remembered me and my favorite drinks and dish each morning at breakfast, often surprising me with something new to try. The room service -- which I did each night after getting back late from the office -- had more than enough variety and was absolutely delicious. Now that I'm home, I wish I could just dial the kitchen. The car service was easy, always on time, and air conditioned woo. The laundry service was the best I've ever used. And the folks around -- at the gym, the doors, the front desk --",5

She replied with 2700 plus taxes .. I asked the total price .. mentioned 3245 inclusive of taxes. This was a wrong calculation as I mentioned the GST should be 18% and total price should be 3186/-. I understand its just a matter of 59 rupees extra but still people earn hard earned money and then want to gift a brunch to their loved ones .. but this 5 star hotel does not value that.

I've stayed at trident for 5+ nights on 2 occasions and I find the property really peaceful and quite. Its like an oasis in the desert. Pawan- front desk manager is a gem- no matter what inconvenience we face- he more than makes up for it. Staff pays attention to detail and the breakfast is always awesome. Especially Chef Sandeep and Rakesh are always willing to try something new and do more to make your experience really good. I can't remember the last time I was able to recall so many names after the visit- this truly speaks about the level of service and quality that separates Trident from other properties. Its also near to the airport and they provide free pick up and drops to close by mall.,5

This place is an experience you‚Äôll never forget. It‚Äôs hard to believe that such a beautiful place is located in the city of Gurgaon.,5
"This hotel was unbelievably beautiful.  We had a room that bordered the reflecting pools so it appeared that the water was right up to your windows, which in fact it was.  Well appointed rooms, comfortable beds and amenities.  The breakfast was really good and bar area nice for a night cap.",5
"I stayed here on a recent visit To Gurgaon.  I had a large room which was reasonably priced. The bed was comfortable and the shower was good. Free bottled water was provided which is a must for India!  The hotel food was good, I am a fussy eater but they even catered for me. There is a sister hotel that you can walk too and use the restaurant and facilities for.  I would like to highlight the fantastic gym and fitness centre at both hotels. Hotel gyms can be pretty basis but this wasn‚Äôt. There was a good selection of free weights, weigh machines and a Smith machine. There were also good cardio machines and a fantastic outdoor swimming pool. Everything you could want.  Outside the hotel it is very much like most Indian cities and not particularly ‚Äòtouristy‚Äô.",5
Everythings apart but the food at trident specially nonveg is sooo awesome as well the service was also good by Mr Akash . Over all everything was just awesome specially the chefs over there were the best cook i can see in the state.,5
As it's been such a lovely trip and at trident it's mind blowing as the kitchen team and the service team made my day at the end of a busy meeting .. specially service done by Mr.Akash was perfect.. Will be back soon with more expectations !,5
"A luxurious exceptional resort-like property amidst the hustle-bustle of Gurugram. The architecture influenced by Rajastan and Mughal empire is magnificient and speaks volume of the experience you are in for. The staff were diligent throughout my stay and ensured best customer experience. I had stayed at a pool facing room which was spacious with all required amenities and had a great decor too. Check-in and Out were extremely smooth. The complimentary breakfast comes with a special menu along with a large buffet.   Though the property is best in terms of location and standards, what made my experience enriching are the staff. They have made my stay special by putting an emphasis on customer care and personal attention to details. A special shoutout to Shreya from the reception",5
He is a very good with amazing skills and very co-operative Thanks Mr.Naman The best part is he is very friendly and helped us in all ways. I would recommend him for other families and for my future visit as well.,5
"Clean, friendly and somewhat palatial.  Very friendly staff, nice breakfast. Only about 25 mins to Delhi Airport and 10 mins car to Gurugram commercial district. Next door to sister hotel which gives easy additional restaurant choice if staying for a longer period. Second time here in 6 months. Will be my default in Gurugram.",5
I have been going to the Trident over a 7 year period.  Its got to become a home from home. The staff are friendly and always do everything to make my stay exceptional. The food in the restaurant is of the highest quality with my favorite being the Sushi. The Indian buffet is also amazing quality. The bar has a friendly relaxed feel to it and the beer is always cold.,5
"This was one of the best stays I have ever had. I stayed there just for a day . Surprisingly- the hotel had found out without my disclosing the same that it was my birthday and starting from the lobby attendant- all the staff members I interacted with during check in greeted me accordingly. The check in was extremely smooth- in fact, other than legally mandatory -copy of identity card  submission, everything was completed in the room. A cake was also provided in the room besides some other decor for birthday. The attendant at the swimming pool was also extremely caring and prompt. Normally- you are on your own while using swimming pools in hotels- but here, you felt pampered.   Konomi- the Pan Asian restaurant serves great food. I am not very knowledgable about Japanese food ",5
Coming after long time to Trident Gurgaon  At lobby bar with my cousin and Manish and Amit  made our evening special the drinks was amazing the bar ambience is awesome  The snacks was awesome fish tikka and chicken tikka  Thank you so much  Manish and Amit we will come soon with our family ,5
"I was initially hesitant to stay and the reason why I did was because of Chef Rakesh. His exceptional care for me and the family and friends that I bring in all of the restaurants in Trident had been exceptional. Yes, I brought my loved ones to experience his royal pampering. Any food that we requested were exquisite as he personally prepares them and oversees execution of his superb wait staff -- Alisha, Prakriti and Neeraj. Thank you, Chef Rakesh, for making dining always a happy bonding experience for all of us in Trident!   To my housekeeper, Mamta, thank you for ensuring that I have a comfortable stay!",4
Thank you for the sumptuous and mouth watering dinner. The risotto and lasagna is worth trying. But the highlight was the mud cake that my little one got to cut on her special day. Thank you for the smile that you brought on her face.,5
"I stayed here with my friends, not that I was unaware of Oberoi group hospitality .. But this particular property exceeded my expectations like how and made our little birthday celebration an experience !! We also had their dinner buffet which was extremely fresh and made to order (display separate) was the best buffet I ever had .. infact the last week only I went for their Sunday brunch again , that wasn‚Äôt as great as the dinner buffet but again the hospitality made me feel extremely happy and welcomed again :) . Their staff is extremely polite  And they leave no card unturned to make you feel like you matter so much to them! I can‚Äôt recall the name of the manager at the time of my stay but he made sure we had everything we needed and TIMELY too . So thank you Trident , I have",5
"Lobby bar is wonderful; Amit helped me out and went the extra mile by accommodating me bringing me the exact wine that I wanted and followed me around the property to make sure I got my refills while exploring the place.  Very good service indeed, thank you Amit!!",5
"I went there with my family and i must say that the property is best in delhi-ncr. Everything is so picturesque and divine that you just forget the hustle of the city for few days. The staff is very courteous, special mention to Mr. Swapnil for being a great host. Service is impeccable. All in all a great stay if you are looking for a break in gurgaon region.",5
"We had a wonderful stay at trident, gurgaon. Special thanks to Chef Rakesh and Ms Shreya who took our kids through a pizza baking session and made sure they had a memorable time. Really appreciate the care. Thanks to the full trident team.",5
It was such a delight to have had you stay at the Trident Gurgaon  The team‚Äôs genuine care and concern as well as all the special touches they provided made my stay memorable.  I fully recommend this hotel in which you will feel special and unique.,5
"I have stayed at the Trident many times beginning in 2013-2014 and my latest visit confirmed why I continue to choose this hotel when returning to Gurgaon.  Their facilities, food, d√©cor and comfort are all to high standards.  However it is their staff that really make the difference by putting an emphasis on customer care and personal attention to details.  For example Shreya (reception) and Mamta (housekeeping) are exceptional in making you feel at home and always greet you with a smile.  Thank you Trident.",5
"My wife and I stayed here for a night, just to unwind from the city hustle. To start with the property itself is picturesque especially the water bodies. We were upgraded to a deluxe category room, and the view from the room was magnificent. Talking about the service, Trident staff is arguably the best in the entire Hospitality business and Gurgaon is no different. (I have experienced about 12-15 different hotel chains, and about 30+ individual hotels). Special mention to executive Sou Chef Bharti Chauhan and her staff member Aakash who took great care of us during dinner and breakfast. I can go on and on about all this, but at the end of the day, you have to accept that its Trident and they never disappoint. Keep up the good work! The benchmark keeps on rising!",5
We truly enjoyed our stay at Trident. The hotel service was magnificent and the room was very spacious. They upgraded us to a suite bcs we added an extra bed. Dont skip the breakfast because the food is delicious and made to order. And enjoy the swimming pool afterward.,5
"We crashed at this Oberoi brand hotel for an afternoon before our flight back home. The grounds, as always for Oberoi, were immaculate, though also a bit confusing as we left after checkout. Service was fantastic, the room spacious and perfect for our 1/2 day stopover, and their room service menu was varied and priced reasonably, a great feature of this brand.  To our delight, it also featured a shower drain that worked well, a first for us in 2 1/2 weeks of travel in India.  All in all, a wonderful choice near the Delhi airport.",5
"I have been staying at the Trident on and off for 3 years or so and the service never ceases to amaze me. This time I was lodging elsewhere but treated myself and my fiancee to a breakfast one morning. In addition to indulging in the sumptuous buffet and a la carte options the chef created the most amazing specialised dishes for us. Not only that but finding out that it was our anniversary we were also gifted a bouquet of roses. As usual the Trident staff went above and beyond. I love this place, the staff and the way that I am treated as a friend and not just a guest!",5
"Just spent two days at the Trident Gurugram for our anniversary. We have been here earlier too, and this visit just reinforces our view that this is among the best hotels we have stayed in. The architecture, a mixture of Indian & Mughal (Saracenic?) is stunning. The large reflecting pool as you enter, the domes, arches and greenery give you an impression of an oasis - and an oasis it is within the urban sprawl of Gurugram. The view of an infinite pool from the pool facing rooms is amazing - a great way to wake up. The hotel is spread on two levels, with the residential rooms at one level and the pool, spa, gym - at a lower level.  True to the Oberoi tradition, the hotel is immaculately maintained, clean and spotless. The hospitality is warm, gracious and welcoming - from the",5
"I had a breakfast buffet voucher so took my wife and daughter on a Sunday to the Cilantro restaurant in Trident Gurgaon. When you enter the Trident you are amazed at the size of place. The water body surrounded by well manicured lawns is spectacular.   We went for the buffet, and the staff was extremely courteous and helpful and went out of their way to make us comfortable. They looked after our every need.  The Chef Rakesh Rana came out and met us, and took my daughter for a cooking demonstration and they both made an omlette together. My daughter was thrilled and came away with a complementary apron and chef hat.   Overall a great experience, but for the size of the property, and how great it looks, I though the breakfast would have been more elaborate. But the staff and Chef",4
"I have stayed at the Trident Gurgaon twice, for 6-weeks at a time. The staff is friendly and went out of their way to make me feel at home. I especially would like to mention Mamta in housekeeping. The hotel is beautiful and peaceful and I felt like I was at a resort. I will definitely stay there again.",5
"Amazing stay..amazing food & amazing staff. They celebrated our anniversary so well, like the way we planned. Good job guys! Keep it up. Special mention to Mohit- a staff person there, very friendly he is! a good photographer. Thanks to Trident team. Memorable anniversary! ",5
"The stay at Trident Gurgaon was extremely satisfying.Impeccable service,ever smiling and helpful staff,meals out of the menu were the Highlight of the stay. The most surprising thing was that on the day of my departure,my car was bought by the valet duly washed.This is something NO hotel has ever done before. I am very happy to have stayed in this property and would strongly recommend to one and all to try their hospitality. Thanks to Mr.Amit Khare,the GM and his team for all assistance.",5
I stayed  here for one night with my family in pool view room.rooms were clean and beautiful.landscape of the hotel was amazing.staff was nice and helpful. I want say special thanks to Mr. Ziaul who help us during midnight. He gave some soft toys for my children. He was nice and well mannered. Thanks  again Ziaul to make our stay memorable. See you soon.,5
"Great housekeeping done by Gaurav Kukreti. He has helped us in everything related to cleaning, food, washroom. Hotel is very nice, excellent ambience, nice pool and spacious rooms. Good job üëç. Thanks to the Trident Gurgaon.",5
The fitness center has a great professional trainer named Naman.  Highly recommended.  He was very knowledgeable about physical fitness.  He showed me some great exercises for working flexibility and strength.  Very helpful and courteous.,5

"The approach to hotel saves time. Ambience is very good, really heart touching. Staffs are very very cordial and I realized here the meaning of true Hospitality. I want to give special thanks to Ziaul for his special attention. I'll highly  recommend this hotel to my fellow travelers for both business and leisure trips. ",5
"The hotel is  in a  great location,  easily approachable, the front desk staff if verry gentle & helping. The breakfast is great & the chef mrs......i don‚Äôt remember the name but she was from Uttar Pradesh nd she was verry gentle and helping lady. Living in this hotel feeling like we are owning it üòÉ, because of the ultimate caring staff. The house keeping staff specially mr. Swapnil Gupta was verry helping nd caring. The hotel property is verry neat and clean. The proper 5* hotel.  ",5
"Superb and easy checkin. Arrived after a long travel at 3 am, was offered hot towel and refreshing beverage. That was only the beginning of my amazing staying experience. The service that I received during my stay was the best I have ever gotten. I never write any reviews but Ishant, Karan, Srawan, Mohit, Suresh and Gaurav Kumar made my stay so special that I felt obligated to return this small favor. Amenities of the hotel were great but it is the people who work there make all the difference. Attention to detail is unmatched, unhidden desire to make hotel's clients happy, food was delicious. I will make sure that going forward I will only stay in this hotel in my future travels to India.",5
"This is a gorgeous hotel conveniently located near the Delhi airport. The rooms are excellent, the grounds lovely, the staff outstanding and the food superb. We have stayed here several times and it is consistently excellent. A beautiful very well run hotel indeed.",5
Superb check-in. I arrived early and they sat me in the bar and offered me beverage. Masala tea is what I ordered and fabulous. The corridor to the room is architecturally beautiful. The room is spectacular. Beautiful big window opens up to garden. Facilities in the room are first class. Ordered in-room dining and delivered fast and the quality of food was just world class. Naan and butter Chicken. Got some shirts ironed and were delivered very well. Superb open gardens with nice flowers. Amazing pool. Great breezy! Going back for sure!,5
"My parents(Deepak Dhawan an Mrs Sunita Dhawan) visited the Hotel.  After their visit, both of them were so much happy, enthusiastic, enjoyful, excited with so much pleasure that they cannot expeess in words.  This visit was for them beyond their imagination.  Right from their arrival till the end of their visit, they had received so much love, affection, kind courtesy and excellent hospitality extended to them that they cannot forget till the last breath of their life. They want to express their sincere thanks, blessings and gratitude to all the staff but in particular, the excellent and marvellous services rendered by Mr. Himanshu, Ms. Mehak and Ms. Nooriyaan which is beyond their expectations.  They wish to express their blessings, good wishes for their long long life and",5
The best Hotel and it was good service at clean nice hotel. And they have a nice room and good breakfast it was really good time and also my son enjoy that too much is good place and they have many space play for children and workout,5
"Excellent food and service. Monu, Nitin and Sameer were extremely hospitable. We look forward to coming back soon.  Let me say this the cilantro is an oasis in gurgaon. A place which absolutely takes the stress of a full working day in gurgaon away.  Please visit and it is an experience you will remember.",5
Bestest services in the restaurant all the staff members are just so humble so familier specially the manager mr.  soumik.here i got Best ever dinning experience in the category of 5 star hotels in Delhi Gurgaon. ,5
"I am in the trident h√¥tel. It is really a beautiful place. It is perfectly clean service is perfect the staff is not only answering all your desire but they propose themselves to help before you have time to ask. We organised a training session in this h√¥tel the room is large and convenient. Let's speak about the pool very large,clean and the service there is really perfect. Rooms are really confortable and extremely clean. The best view is the swimming pool side. The breakfast propose a large choice of western and indian food you will find quality and quantity. I highly recommand this hotel if you need to stop at gurgaon",5
"The property is beautiful and accessible but what seperates them from the crowd is their staff and service. Top notch. I was pampered from the entrance and they took care of everything small or big. Food for the kids, local transport. I cant find a single reason not to visit. I also want to compliment their staff for their devotion to what they do. Outstanding.",5
"I have stayed at Trident before, but was very excited to come back to this oasis in a very busy city. Great experience as alwasy, from my house keeper Akshay and his towel 'art' (see photo attached) to Naman the personal trainer.",5
"This is a superb hotel conveniently located 15 minutes to the airport. The level of service was impeccable on the two separate nights we stayed here. Spotlessly clean, beautifully presented and outstanding service. We left our suitcases to go off on a trip for 3 nights and arrived late back. They had already organised for them to be on our room which was just one example of the ‚Äò extra mile ‚Äò they go. Brilliant would highly recommend - wonderful staff.",5
"We stayed at this hotel because it has easy access to the airport but what a wonderful surprise. This is an oasis of calm away from the horrendous traffic and the accompanying noise. The rooms are extremely comfortable, the pool is incredible and the surroundings beautiful. What really sets the Trident apart though is the service, the staff here are amazing. Shreya on the front desk and Prakriti in the restaurant deserve special mention but every member of the team was excellent. This hotel is ideal for couples, families and business travellers; a rare combination.",5
"The hotel is lovely, yet - but more importantly, the staff is very helpful and very gracious.  Tarun, the gentleman who took care of my room each day, was delightful and enthusiastic, as was the rest of the staff.",5
"The most amazing hotel, I cannot fault it, the best staff and service I have ever come across in the world, I don't usually write reviews but sincere thanks to all, especially exceptional fitness instructor Naman Kumar, and General Manager Mr Khare.",5
"This is my 3rd extended stay in Trident Gurgaon and has been as comfortable as ever. The staff goes beyond their duty to help you and do that extra bit which turns into delight. I want to mention quite a few names: Soumik and Mehak from reception, Chef Bharti  and Chef Sandeep from  Cilantro, Mohit on the door, Akanksha and Arti from room services, Sajit, Nikhil and Prakriti from Cilantro and Naman from Gym.  Each of them helped me and my family stay to be extra nice here. Every staff in this hotel has that attitude to help you and make you comfortable. I am sure we are coming here soon many more times. Thanks Trident!!",5
"A beautiful hotel with scenic views at every turn as you enter. A sense of serenity and the feeling of an oasis with greenery and water everywhere. I was upgraded to a Max room which was beautifully appointed and had a nice view of the garden from the first floor (the building only has two floors).  The hotel is somewhat sprawling, and can be confusing to get around at first.  The staff are friendly and solicitous, and part of my check-in was done in the room, although the process did take a little bit longer than I expected.   I wanted to order food that was not on the room service menu, so I was immediately brought a restaurant menu from one of the hotel restaurants, and I ordered a stunning lamb curry with all the trimmings. One of the best curries I‚Äôve ever had.  The idea of",5
"Delicious food and the staff is sooooo hospitable. Absolutely loved being there. Tried some sushi- best sushi in NCR easily! The restaurant has great ambience and the hotel is breathtakingly beautiful! But it is truly the staff which makes it worth the visit. Do give t a try, you will not be disappointed. ",5
I stayed in room 311.Room was very comfortable.Room cleaning was excellently done by Gaurav.Facilities were good.Breakfast was good.I wish to visit again in future. Lunch and Dinner were also average.View was very good.Gardens and swimming pool were had a good view.,5
Excellent 5 star hotel with underwhelming service and beautiful ambience. I had a boring experience at Saffron one of their restaurants. The staff are rigid and not as nice as other Trident hotels I've visited and stayed in.,4
Excellent facilities and restaurants. All staff members were very helpful. We used the pool and spa facilities which were well maintained. Our fight was delayed and reception staff proved very helpful in sorting things out.,5
Magnificent hotel set in beautiful grounds with spectacular pool area.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The service we received from all the staff was exceptional. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the lounge in the evening and the breakfast buffet in the morning was very good.,5
"Needed a break from fast going life, so I booked Trident gurgaon. Hotel will give you resort like feel. It's designed is inspired by Rajasthani & Moroccan architecture, palm tree courtyard, fire torch at pool area.  Stayed in Superior pool view rooms, on special request I was allotted two interconnected rooms as I was traveling with my 2 kids.  Special thanks to hotel staff for worm welcome as it was my 7 months sons 1st trip .  Located 30 min approx from airport, 5 min from ambiance mall, 10 min from cyber hub.

The rooms are beautiful, beds comfortable and the housekeeping staff are excellent and thoughtful. Mine left me a candle one night & a loofa sponge another. The pools and garden views at this hotel are breathtaking & stunning day and night. The food in Cilantro was excellent and the bar staff were wonderful. The Trident hotel is truly one of the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed in.",5
"This is primarily a business hotel not far from the airport with excellent facilities for tourists as well.   Everything you need!.  It is the staff,  however,  who star - obliging and keen to please. Rooms are very well appointed.   Food very tasty. ",5
I stayed just one night at Trident Gurgaon but the experience was very good! The hotel is so charming and the pool area is absolutely wonderful! The hotel smells so good!! Very sophisticated! Staff is so nice! I recommend it for sure ,5
"I had planned this Holi stay at this place and this was one of best vacation I ever had . complete satisfied with the stay, breakfast was well laid and all cusines we're available with best tastes full marks to the team of Trident",5
"Overall, great hotel. Beautiful colonial style hotel. Non high rise on a large estate. Have stayed in Westin, Leela and this hotel. My preference is Trident.  Room size: decent, large enough for one person or a couple with working table and sitting area. Bed/pillow: relatively comfortable except the pillows which are quite flat, I had to use 3 pillows. The bed was made up of 2 single beds hence the divider in the middle isn‚Äôt comfortable when I was sleeping in the middle (had to sleep on one side of the bed only). Lighting: ok, somewhat dim. Would have prefer brighter lighting especially when it is a business hotel (being, guests are most likely to be working in the room). Cleanliness: good except the bathroom as the shower screen on the bathtub is slightly mouldy. ",5
I would like to appreciate MR. TARUN who give  the great hospitality service.Thanks a lot ..see you again when i will be back again. Room condition is great. Thank you soo much trident for the great service.,5
"I have always been wanting to stay here, since my childhood...And finally, I could take the time out to stay here for a night...the property is just AMAZINGGGGG !!!!...everything is larger than life...like huge hallways...big doors...wide alleys...many water bodies...I loved the fact that the whole property gave Egyptian vibes...the staff was kind and interactive and efficient...It was my birthday and they gave left me a lovely mousse cake in our bedroom...(I felt the rooms were small, but were clean and comfortable)...the breakfast spread was good ...also they have a cute mini copper that gives free one way rides on first come-first serve basis to guests, till cyberhub ...Over all I had an amazing time here..and I shall keep returning...",5
"When I say this review I really mean it! I‚Äôve traveled around the world and teach hospitality for a living and when I say great service I have to say Trident wins for my best. The doormen in particular are top notch as well as housekeeping. Anything you need they will accommodate and if they can‚Äôt they will come up with second best.   I booked this hotel as a business and it was a bit pricy for the area but the transportation was arranged so it made it very easy. If you need to go anywhere local they drive you, Ambience mall I know.   Room service department really did a fantastic job with remembering my order from previous night, my likes and dislikes. I ordered at least 12 times during my 6 nights.   Housekeeping was unbelievable in making sure I was comfortable. From the",5

Stayed for a night on a business trip to Delhi / Gurgaon. The hotel is really spread out so it‚Äôs a bit of a walk to the room and to the restaurants and gym. That‚Äôs what makes it a bit inefficient if you are on a quick business trip.    The room was comfortable and in the usual Oberoi style. The gym was really well appointed and in good order.   The breakfast service was also too laid back. We were in a hurry but service was so slow. Wonderful food but still not focused on the business traveler. ,4
"Arriving in Delhi on Day 1 - I wanted to roam around and get a feel of the city - sights, sounds, smells, colours.  This is NOT the hotel to do that.  Located a good 30min or so outside of the main city, in the middle of what seems like a construction site, you are stuck in the hotel unless you have a driver.  Obviously we should have checked first location wise but when making our booking of the whole tour, we were encouraged by our agent to stay here.  Whilst the service is genuinely top class - every door has someone waiting to open for you - and security is excellent - the overall feel of the hotel was more of a giant concrete structure with lots of water features - a mega hotel that lacks a bit of soul/character.  If i was here on business, I'd stay here with no hesitation",4
"We really enjoyed our short stay here. Our room was spotless with every amenity, the main restaurant was very good indeed for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with impeccable service. We also enjoyed the ambiance of the bar area. Highly recommended!",5
"It is always a pleasure to come back to Trident. I love the open plan layout of the hotel unlike most in Delhi. Staff, as always, is attentive and courteous. Express check-in options are available. Rooms are well done up and spacious. Nice amenities. Great breakfast spread. Highly recommended.",5
I often travel to Gurgaon. This hotel simply amazes me with thiet wonderful d√©cor & warm service. The staff is very hospitable & turnaround is very quick. I liked the brunch on Sunday. It was very sumptuous & had wide variety of stuff to choose from.,4
"Lovely property . Very different from other hotels in Gurgaon.  It's very quite and cosy, palatial architecture.  Location is very central that one can move around easily in Gurgaon . Rooms are quite big. Staff is very courteous and helpful.",5
"The noise of the city barely reaches you at this oasis away from it all, yet in a great location for cyber city.  Staff is highly attentive, the restaurants strong, and concierge arranged cars and tours for us very well.  I very good nights sleep (for the most part, avoid room 111 as it is next to a staff hallway) and a clean room top it off.",5
"Rooms are lovely, excellent gym open 24 hours, lovely bar and restaurants offering superb food. The infinity pools (is that what they are celled?) are somewhat OTT and completely at odds with and aloof from the surrounding area, so not 5 star for me.  That said, well worth a visit",4
This is really a beautiful resort with state of art facilities. The food is mind blowing and so service. The special mention of Naman from Trident Fitness who took my 30mins class for reducing fat and must say it was enlightening experience. He is very skilled and knowledgeable. Must meet this guy. Thanks to Trident for amazing hospitality. ,5
"The hotel has a nice peaceful ambiance and the food is good too.  The lobby area, restrooms are good.  External fountain and evening lightning is soothing. However, wifi is chargable which is uncommon now a days. ",5
"how can you describe a perfect hotel? not by its interior, not by its luxury - both are things the Trident Gurgaon has in abundance. No, the perfect stay is when the attitude of the people working there is more like when familiy welcomes you back home than just a normal business hotel welcome. its the attitude of the staff that makes this hotel so special.  Starting the people opening the doors for you with a smile that would stop any bad feelings to the checkin with Lovely Mrs. Shreya, where again you feel more like coming home. Mr. Amit Khare indeed is leading the best hotel in the world when it comes to the attitude of the people and how they treat every guest. Mr. Sanjay Pathak in the bar indeed is a Master of exquisite and special Cocktails (just try his ginger ale)... Mrs.",5
"Stunning hotel, the surroundings as you can see from the pictures are beautiful. It's a low rise building, very conscious of the energy and conservation. There is an outdoor pool (sad to say I didn't get a chance to use it) and on site spa facilities that is open till midnight. Location is central with offices and shops close to the hotel.  The rooms are luxurious and very tastefully decorated. The large work desk and strong wifi made it ideal for business travellers.  The restaurant breakfast was lovely with a choice of Western and Eastern cuisine. So much to choose from.  The service from the bell hops, waiters to the security, all friendly and professional. Highly recommend. ",5
The beds in the Trident need to be changed. The last few trips (I do 5-6 every year) have been difficult to sleep comfortably. Staying in the Oberoi this trip because I need to sleep. I need to add more detail or TripAdvisor won‚Äôt let me save. Change the beds. ,4
We stayed here for 3 nights on our trip to India. Great resort hotel at great local. It is an oasis in the chaos of the place. Great ambience. Fantastic service. The included breakfast was sumptuous and you have good choices of food. The omelette was cooked to perfection each time.  Great friendly service at the whole resort hotel. ,5
This was my second visit to this hotel and it was even better than the last.The staff are always very welcoming and absolutely do everything possible to make sure that we were comfortable and settled in well. Mr Pawan Chahar who is the front office Manager is exceptionally good at his job and very accommodating.He was happy to make time to get our feedback and is willing to take it as a positive experience and improve.The rooms are very nice and comfortable and extremely clean.The food is amazing and they have a great menu available for breakfast as well.There is an amazing Indian restaurant in house which has to be tried.Kudos to the entire staff! Keep up the good work! Best hotel in guargoan!üôèüôè,5
"I stayed at Trident for couple of nights on 27-28 January 2019 on business.  The hotel is amazingly flawless in all departments, be it quality of rooms, cleanilness, servicem food and courteousness of the staff.  Despite trying hard I could not find a single flaw in the hotel.  The open areas are difficult to maintain clean due to pigeon menance but I saw cleaning staff scrubbing the floors and keeping the place spotless.  Oberoi has done exceptional job in training its staff to provide world class service with Indian hospitality.  I can safely say that in last 5 years I havent had such a WOW experience anywhere else.  Keep it up guys and a big thumbs up for the team.  You guys rock",5
This hotel is so beautiful.  The gorgeous scent from the frangipan trees (I think) was wonderful.  I took photographs but wished I could bottle the scent.  The pool was amazing and the blue used for all the water features is superb. Food and staff amazing and polite.  The rooms are top quality. Wonderful stay.  Thank you ,5
"Everything about the hotel was great. Awesome ambience, awesome food & awesome staff. I am a fitness freak and I loved the Gym as well, specially Naman, whom I found to be very courteous and a great trainer.",5
Right from the moment you walk into the hotel - the architecture transports you into a uniquely modern yet traditional atmosphere. The 50ft ceilings never cease to amaze. But the most amazing experience is in the service - a service that reads into your mind and adjusts very well to your mood. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable.  The chefs and kitchen staff need a special mention - they are magicians....cooking up some very delectable dishes with ease. They make you feel like a king in his palace. The concept of service and guest interaction is evident. The chefs are always available. Kudos to all of you. ,5
I stayed here for business. Everyone is so polite and kind.  The hotel is very clean and people are constantly in motion keeping it spotless.  I actually saw someone scrubbing the floor tiles. Pool area is very pretty. The food was very good at the restaurant.   Rooms were comfortable and well equipped with nice toiletries available as well as bottled water.  The location is convenient to get to most things. This was a second visit and my go to spot in this area ,4
Stayed on business for a few days. Very nice and clean hotel - almost palatial. Tucked away off a busy road you wouldn‚Äôt know you were so close to the bustling traffic nearby.  Has gym and pool and attentive service. Breakfast in a nice dining room with an Indian take on some western dishes that were very good and the Indian breakfasts were also delicious. Would happily stay here again.,5
"An oasis amid the concrete desert of modern Gurgaon , close to the Delhi airport,is how you would react on encountering this Trident property. Beautifully designed , an artistic blend of European and Mughal architecture and painstakingly maintained , the greens and the blue water bodies are soothing to the eyes. Add to it the warmth and pleasantness of entire Trident team from security to the front desk under Nikhil Kher, to the eager to serve restaurants staffed by Karan, Manish, Ajita , Neema et all , and you'd feel wanted, welcome and almost at home. A visit to this place prompts repeats.",5
Stayed in Trident Gurgaon in March 2018 to attend the wedding of our friend‚Äôs daughter. The hotel exterior & interior is indeed majestic and awesome. The lavish use of water & redstone enhanced the beauty of the hotel exterior design - beautiful ! It was the perfect venue for a perfect weddingüëçüèª And rooms are grandly designed & furnished. Our room overlooked the pond and the view was breathtaking. The staff were very warm and welcoming - impeccable service. Would love to return to Delhi just to stay in Trident Gurgaon!,5
Went to Cilantro with friends to enjoy this lavish buffet  All the dishes served were simply amazing  Thank to chef for making such delicious food   Simply loved it   Would highly recommend this place if you are  around Gurugram  Kudos to kitchen team of Trident Gurugram   Special thanx to chef Sandeep,5
"One of the best fine dining hotel Trident Gurugram !!  Loved its ambiance , food and hospitality.  Special thanks to Chef Sandeep Kalra for making it all more special day for my family remember !!  Would highly recommend this place to everyone !!",5
"If you want to experience a beautiful property and a mesmerizing ambience, this is the place to go to. The fine dining restaurant(saffron) was a treat in itself and delicious delicacy goes without saying. A Must visit.",5
"Went to Saffron for family get together  Best experience of life  Food , ambiance, peaceful surrounding  their hospitality is one of the best in gurgaon !! Their dishes are simply amazing  Special thanks to Chef Sandeep for making the day all the more memorable for all of us üòä Thanks to all the staff members of Trident ü•Ç",5
"Very comfortable hotel with amazing service. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff is attentive and always willing to help. There is a choice of restaurants in the hotel if you don't feel like going out, with a decent variety to meet different tastes. The hotel even organized a day trip to the Taj Mahal for me, including hiring a local guide, which I highly recommend. The guide is only $20, and besides hearing the history behind the palace, it comes with a priceless convenience: you cut pretty much all lines.",5
"The hotel is gorgeous in the architectural sense. Lots of space both indoors and outdoors. Extremely hospitable staff. Food was delicious. We got invited to free cocktails in the evening. We took the hotel car up to Agra and back. Drive was smooth and comfortable.  All in all, great!",5
"What a spectacular hotel. We checked in late, arriving at night to see the Trident beautifully lit. Service, facilities, food, beverage and meals were faultless. Worth every penny and then come. Highly recommended.",5
"On our last day of holidays  in India, we chose to stay at the Trident Gurgaon.  After staying with the Oberoi group (Oberoi do own the Trident) for the duration of our holiday, we decided to stay at the Trident Gurgaon on our last night as we had a very early flight out of New Delhi.   We were expecting a mediocre hotel. In fact I told our son to expect something like a Hilton, Novatel or Pan pacific.  OMG (Oh my goodness) we were so surprised at the architecture of the hotel, but how the staff embraced and were so proud of their hotel. Its refreshing to see staff make their work place their own. Fantastic   The ambience of the place was amazing, from the grounds to the rooms. Impeccable.   We were planning to have room service and chill in our rooms; but got a boost from the",5
"Trident is the best hotel to stay in while in Gurgaon when u are considering safety security warmth and first class care and service. They never seize to amaze me with how sensitive and thoughtful every staff is with their guests. I may be just one of thousands of their very satisfied guests all year round but everyday they make me feel very welcome and cared for.   Two thumbs up (+ all my fingers up üòÄ) to all the staff in Cilantro esp to Chef Deep Manish Neema Kaini Karan. I am still in awe with how keen for detail everyone is in Cilantro, they know what I eat and not eat without me telling them! They all managed to let me gain weight considering I am picky eater üòÄ .. High five to all the Housekeeping staff esp to Neeraj Mansi Aakansha Mumta also to the 2 guys who brought me",5
"I've always enjoyed excellent service and facilities at this hotel when I've stayed, and my recent trip this week for 2 nights was again excellent. The staff are so courteous and go the extra mile for every request to make sure their guests are handled very well. Received excellent service from Divya at the front desk as well as Himanshu Anand. They were very good in dealing with my queries and requests for my business trip and they were very prompt and efficient in helping me.  I would never hesitate to stay at this hotel again for sure.",5
"Lovely hotel surrounded by the hustle of guragon. Good gym, lovely pool and nice setting  We loved the staff and at night it is stunning. Only downside is you need to get a cab to get across the road to cyber hub Would recommend",5
"My partner and I stayed here after touring around and it was such a welcome contrast to some of the more rustic places we had stayed at. The hotel is beautiful, spacious, modern and very comfortable. The customer service was excellent too.  We had dinner in the restaurant and the head waiter looked after us to perfection. I wish I knew his name as I would give him a mention (the tall one!). The restaurant is expensive (London prices) but the food and service were excellent. The breakfast was fabulous too. My only regret is that we weren‚Äôt there for another night! ",5
"This is a hotel you must visit. The food is exquisite and the service is second to none. You will not be disappointed. Managers like Pawan, Chef Bharti, and Gaurav will make your stay just as pleasant as can be. I mention these names because I do not think they get recognized enough. They really make you feel like home. The hotel does so much to accommodate. Your stay will be pleasant if you come here. It‚Äôs just makes traveling an ease. ",5
"I would like to specially thank Executive Chef Ram and his team at the Cilanto Restaurant, Trident Gurgaon. Their hospitality even during mid night is exemplary and makes you come back to the property every time. They went out of their way to make us feel special.   Take a bow, team Cilantro.",5
"My wife Ashleigh and I stayed in the Trident Hotel for three weeks whilst on a work trip. The experience was fabulous! The facilities were brilliant, the food excellent and the staff made our stay memorable. Not only did they do a great job, all staff went above and beyond to create service magic. We were treated like family and will always remember our stay. We would like to thank all the staff but especially to Aakansha, Arpit, Mohit and Guarav for all their kindness and fantastic hospitality. We would definitely recommend the Trident Hotel to anyone staying in the Gurgaon area and hope to return in the future!",5
"We stayed at the Trident for one night as we were flying out from Delhi the next day.  The hotel is spacious and has a nice spa and pool. The Japanese restaurant was very good. As we had an early start we ordered breakfast in our room, which was delicious. We had breakfast included in our room rate and we were not charged extra for the room service.",4
"The hotel is a calm place. Much smaller than we expected but perfect in so many ways. The room was well appointed and very comfortable. The pool area is really lovely. The food in all restaurants was superb. However the best thing about this hotel was the outstanding excellent service by every member of staff. They were so welcoming, unassuming and highly attentive. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5
"Always been a oberoi fan, but my weekend stay at trident gurgaon was extra special. I was craving delhi delicacy rajma chawla and chef Rakesh Rana put a special efforts and made me a portion of ultra delicious rajma chawal inspite of it not being available for the Sunday brunch. And of course the Sunday brunch spread and cocktail menu is a must try for any guests staying over the weekend.   Look forward to my next visit here!",5
"Was there for the weekend and the property is great. Rain played spoilsport, but the experience was great. They were courteous and very helpful. Great place to relax..pool is not heated and is outdoor, but great place to relax. Sadly, due to the location, outside the hotel is not picturesque.",5
"It's a very beautiful hotel. Overall experience was great!!!! stayed there for 5 nights, excellent services. Chef Bharti and her entire team were very helpful, polite and courteous. The environment in the hotel is very peaceful and relaxing.",5
"We spent our last two nights at the Trident, at the end of our 16 day tour of Rajasthan. This is truly a 6 star hotel with beautiful rooms and wonderful friendly staff: nothing was too much trouble. We had our best meal of the trip in the restaurant. Special thanks to Alisha, Saffron, Angel and the rest of the team.",5
"On arrival, loved the hotel design, more than satisfied with the room and the view was amazing. Ate in the main restaurant at least once a day and the selection and quality was excellent. However the best thing about the stay was the staff, never stayed in a hotel before where you receive such a fantastic welcome which certainly lasted all my stay. Nothing is too much trouble and everyone works so hard to achieve that, though I must mention Prakriti in the Cilantro team whose care and attention was outstanding. Just need to convince my manager that I need to come back to Delhi again very soon so I can return to the Trident.",5
"The architecture has a wow factor - infinity pools and reflected colours; soaring ceilings and columns; polished floors and a sense of space/calm. Three weeks as a tourist in India - my 87 year old companion declares this was one of her favorite hotels. I think it was probably because of the staff in the cafe, who sensibly supported her needs without fuss. Room, cafe, pool and reception all as you would expect from Trident.",5
"From pick up at the airport to the reception , WiFi support, late hours dining to the housekeeping all personell were extremely friendly and supportive.  Especially the housekeeper Mansi was very nice and offered being a guide for a shopping tour for me, as it is my first time in India.",5
"My husband and I went to trident for dinner at their Japanese restaurant on 17/11/18. Food was not up to our expectation but the girl waiting on our table was very sweet, she was very polite and quick on her feet, so we were very happy with the service. The thing that really put me off was, there was a family seated on the outside table, the girl waiting on our table was also waiting on their table. From what we saw we could not hear them but we could tell that they were rude and demeaning to this girl but the girl did everything to the best of her ability, then after a while the vip (I'm assuming) guest called the chef and complained about that girl, and the chef gave her a word or two standing very close to our table. I'm surprised that being a chef he was very unprofessional",1
"We arrived quite late on our first night in India what a wonderful introduction to one of our best holidays ever. Beautiful hotel oozing understated elegance. Friendly staff and an experience both my husband and I will remember for a very long time. I can't fault our stay, well done to everyone involved A fine lesson in less is more, we hope to return",5
Good ambience. Well dressed and courteous staff. Rooms are well decorated and comfortable. I had stayed there for 3 days and staff were very Good and courteous. I really want to recommended  for every traveller. ,4
"Nice hotel beautifully laid out grounds, good service.  Breakfast excellent.  During day very quiet as tends to be used by business people.  Free shuttle to mall.  For any other transport need make own transport arrangements as hotel transport/transfers very expensive.",4
"I spent 3 luxurious nights at the Trident Gurgaon.  This is a luxury hotel that is not ostentatious but very elegant in design.  There is a beautiful swimming pool and a gym to keep you occupied.  The restaurant has very good food and the staff are friendly and helpful.  They went out of their way to accommodate me.  This is a fantastic hotel for relaxing and pretending you aren't in a huge city.  The only down side is the location.  However, the hotel will take you to the nearby shopping mall and pick you up when you're done.",5
An oasis in the hustle and bustle of Gurgaon. Excellent & friendly staff. They really go the extra mile for you. Great pool with a relaxed & chilled atmosphere. Loads of food options at the hotel. Good security as well. Well worth a stay whether on a leisure or business trip. ,5
Never write reviews but honestly... what an amazing experience!  - Amazing Staff & Service - Location is very good; near the DLF Cyber City - GYM is very good!  - Breakfast very good Highly recommended.!,5
"The Trident Gurgaon is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in my life (and I have seen many). The property itself, the staff and restaurants are just top notch. We will come back soon. Thank you Trident Gurgaon.",5
one of the finest hotel in New Delhi and a very special thanks to the staff who made my parents wedding anniversary so special and to my most special friend who is a part of this beautiful property. Rashika Sharma who made our lunch so memorable and her efforts literally who made us smile.,5
"Best hotel I have ever stayed, it‚Äôs in middle of city but you feel like you are in Reshort very peaceful place. Swimming pool and spa very clean and spot on. All hotel staff is very professional, polite and friendly always welcoming you with smile.  Restaurant staff is also friendly and top class service. I feel like I was treated so well by all staff, make you feel  so special and personal touched, big thanks to deep and Ameet. rooms are well organised very clean, highly recommend hotel.",5
"I stay here egularly on business but recently had the pleasure of taking my wife to the Trident and she was not disappointed.  A beautiful, friendly luxury hotel with an exceptional team.  As part of the Oberoi group that's not surprising but the Gurgaon team really go out of their way to make you feel special with some lovely personal touches.  ",5
"I love the trident hotel chain and have stayed in many. Gurgaon is no different but the breakfast process here seems like a bit of a car crash when it comes to ordering omlettes and the like. Plus the choices are not brilliant. Compare this to the Westin breakfast experience and there is no competition, you would want that every time. Room for improvement here Trident. ",3
I visited Trident last week. The ambience is very good and the staff courteous. Had an Amazing experience. had Indian food at the restaurant saffron. Food was good and flavorsome!  The torchlights at the entrance and the water body is a feast to the eyes.                                                                                                                                          ,5
The food is very good little high priced .chef Rakesh really took care of us .the place was full on a week day . The quality of food was excellent . The restaurant cilantro is where we ate the manager Karan was rather rude and not hospitable .very stern guy,4
"It is an amazing experience to stay at Trident. Hospitality is par excellence. It seems that almost all the staff know your name. Service is personalized, from chef Ram with his culinary recommendations, to Vedika who wrote a beautiful note for my daughter. From the kitchen to the laundry services, every aspect of our stay was memorable.  ",5
"It was such a pleasant stay in Trident! Beautiful outlook accompanied with best in class services of the staff, made it one of the best hotel I have stayed so far. It's location is just 20 mins from airport and very near to the business district. Special thanks to Chef Deep, Chef Bharti, Chef Rakesh and all kitchen staff and waiters for their good work on making my stay very memorable. I even got that chance to learn some cooking from the Chefs. Special thanks also to Indeer, Mansi, Arpit and all housekeeping staff for making me feel like home and pampered me with occasional biscuits and flowers. Special thanks to all front desk staff as well for their patience and friendliness.  I am definitely looking forward to stay there again if I am in town.",5
"The Oberoi in Gurgaon is marvellous, but I much prefer the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the next door Trident! It has a warm Indian feel, instead of a stainless steel, glass and mirrored finish feel! It draws a lot of ambiance from the early Twentieth Century grand hotels and large estate houses and palaces of ‚Äúnew‚Äù Delhi. The s is truly a great hidden gem in the chaos of Gurgaon!",5
"Have stayed here before but each time it just gets better. The hotel, the rooms, the service - they are just excellent. The service is some of the best I have encountered in India. The restaurants and bar are also fantastic. Dinner or breakfast is an experience - this places ticks all your boxes...!",5
"We went there for my birthday and the staff upgraded my room, surprised us with decoration and cake. You have access to Oberoi aslo while staying in Trident. Both Oberoi and Trident pools are amazing !",5
"Stayed at the Trident for 3 days late september and truly enjoyed the hotel. Excellent facilities, great breakfast and a service level beyond comparison. The guy attending my room left a note and nutrition bars because he knew i would visit the fitness room - that is what I call attention. Highly recommended.",5
"Staff & service at hotel is unmatched , extremely hospitable & cirtious . They make you feel special .  Nice ambience & a fantastic place to spend your weekends away from hustle & bustle of metropolis   One gets feel of staying at a resort & food & service at hotel makes you additional relaxing .i would rate quality of staff at Trident Gurgaon one of the best in trident hotels .  Keep it up .....",5
Stayed here for 1 night only and experience was very good. Hotel infrastructure is excellent and hotel staff was very welcoming and friendly. Food quality and hygiene was also very good. Looking forward to stay again.,5
"Trident Gurgaon is a hidden gem in the midst of all the chaos in Gurgaon. Not only the hotel is beautiful but the true strength of this hotel  is the excellent service that this hotel provides.   Rooms: I personally recommend the rooms on the first level. I did pay a little extra for this, but it was money well spent. The room had a beautiful view of the serene pool and the water body.   I was only there for a day but would definitely go back for a longer duration with my entire family.",5
"Situated right in the heart of city, Trident Gurgaon almost gives you the feel of the luxurious Oberoi Resorts in Agra or Udaipur. It has beautiful gardens n very efficient staff. Starting from our smooth in-room checkin, to the beautiful room that we were assigned, to the warm and courteous staff at the coffee shop, specially chef Deep and chef Ram who personally took care of our special requests, and the guy who took our checkout, I think his name was Gaurav...  All the various departments come together so magnificently and make our experience truly gratifying...full marks to each one of them. After having experienced such a remarkable level of service I have specially created an account on trip advisor so that I could let everybody know about the amazing experience that me",5
"Gurgaon Trident is the best hotel in my years travel across over 30 countries. The architecture is amazing but the service is more than I can imagine. Every of the employees have big smiles at you all the time, every day. They always like to know if u r happy or comfortable in the stay, ur eat, ur needs. Starting from arranging me a pick up car in last minute, and showed me passion in a short introduction to hotel when I checked in at midnight. Care about my feedback to Japanese cuisine as well as explanation to every local dishes I showed interest. Even brought me shoe bag as the employee saw my leather shoes during house keeping and like to protect shoes as their own, I‚Äôm very touched. Even helped me to reach out my next hotel to arrange me pick up car and confirm my booking",5
"My experience with The Trident, Gurgaon has been faultless. Having been collected from the airport in their complimentary limousine, I was driven to the hotel in the comfort of an air conditioned vehicle offering WiFi, which, after a long journey, enabled me to make contact with home via iMessage immediately. Small things making a big difference!  Every aspect of my stay has been superb and every interaction with the hotel team has been a warm & pleasant experience. From the reception staff at check-in to the team in the restaurants & bars or Mansi from housekeeping, who almost pre-empts my next requirements, this stay has been of the highest standard.  The hotel is very well equipped with first class facilities, and, in the bustling biz of Gurgaon, it is a tranquil hideaway in",5
"The staff at the Trident - Gurgaon make it a priority to know their guests. Chef Deep is happy to suggest specialties or make whatever you prefer.  The dining staff including Ashu, Samir, and Manesh have greeted me each day with a welcoming smile and ensure you want for nothing.  The Housekeeping staff, especially Aakansha pay attention to detail and make sure you feel at home with special touches such as your favorite fresh fruits in the room.",5
This Hotel is an amazing experience. Upon entering the Hotel past the incredibly efficient parking staff the first view is a large pool lit by flames.  The foyer is impressive and there you are met by amazingly friendly and professional staff. I have never encountered such friendly staff who will do anything to make your stay special. Special mention to the hotel restaurant staff including Ajuti and Angel who went out of their way to make dining so memorable. Definitely worth staying in if you are visiting Delh. My two weeks flew by. The well equipped  gym and pool provide a relaxing and healthy experience and an easy way to use unwind. Recommended.   ,5
"I have special dietary requirements as I follow a Ketogenic diet. Any hotel can make what you ask for. However, Deep (Chef) and Karen (Waiter) proactively go out of their way to cater to my requirements. They prepare for me a special keto salad without any prompts. This is an example of service excellence... staff get to know you as an individual. In this hotel I am not just another guest. Great service from everyone delivered with a BIG smile. Lots of hotels have exceptional quality rooms and facilities in India. What's makes a hotel stand out is it's people and service! Well done to all the people at Trident for making business travel that more comfortable when I'm away from family.",5
Kamran from housekeeping is an all-star. Kamran displays what it means to give 5 star service. He and few others are the reason why I will always stay at trident. Could not have received a better service. 10/10! Thank you Kamran and team. ,5
"Have been staying Trident Hotel for days now and the staff never cease to amaze me with their attentiveness and really world class service. Especially Mansi who never fails to check up on me and make sure that my stay is really comfortable, enjoyable and princess-like. Staff are really well trained and has a special way of making guests feel really special and welcome. ",5
"The Trident has clearly earned it's 5 stars the old fashioned way! The property is beautiful and we'll maintained. The staff was excellent, and and the restaurants top notch. Special kudos to Prakriti, Ajita, and Mansi for helping to make my stay even better. ",5

They are so attentive and the service is second to none. Thank you trident team for looking after me so well as always!",4
"Very nice place, my first time here. Recommended by a friend. They have a wood pizza oven in the restaurant which i thought was great. Came from Chandigarh for some work and really wanted some good food. Not disappointed. ",5
"Located near Cyber City and 25 minutes from the Dehli airport, this hotel surpassed all my expectations in terms of amenities and the quality of the personnel.  Both restaurants on site are excellent and serve a mix of traditional and western fare - try the Dossa for breakfast - you will not be disappointed.  The rooms are very nice with an excellent bed, stocked mini bar, and same day laundry service. The fitness center is fully outfitted and overlooks the sunken pool. Standard (free) and high speed (pay) Wi-Fi is available. The standard was too slow for me to use zoom videoconferencing, but the high speed worked well and could be active on up to 8 devices. Wi-Fi coverage on the whole campus is excellent.  The attitude and friendliness of the staff is the biggest selling point",5
Very good servis and staff  help me a lot of. Hotel look perfect. Food is very good. Thank you very much. Is close to airport. I tralel from Slovakia the hotel help le fimd my passport and thank you all very good ,5
"I am only 2 days in to a 21 day stay but I wanted to share a review based on my first couple of days.  The hotel is just WOW! The architecture is just beautiful and the whole feel of the hotel is driven by the amazing place it occupies.  The service is excellent. Staff are so accommodating and happy to help.  The personal touches I have received in a short time have been exceptional and gratefully appreciated.  Last night I returned from a long day at work to find a lovely note from my housekeeper Tejas. It was accompanied by a bunch of fresh flowers, a small gift and freshly baked cookies.  Divine!! Thank you Tejas and all the staff at The Trident. Looking forward to the rest of my stay. ",5
"Trident is right in the heart of the city. Even on a busy day it will give you a calm, composed getaway from the hustle bustle. The staff is really courteous and thoughtful. We dined at The Cilantro and food was light, aromatic and simple with a flair for one of a kind experience.   Reflection pool is a sight to behold. The long iconic spaces are modelled to make you forget the world outside.",4
"It was an amazing experience staying at the property. Everything was perfectly managed by the staff. Room was quite good and perfectly managed, it was my birthday so it was nicely decorated.Staff was also very co-operative.",5
"This is my first experience here and it was amazing. Right from the picturesque views  to ethnic architecture mixed with modern styles, it was an experience worth having. The staff and services are top notch. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again for a littl longer stay here. ",5
Its an amazing place for dining. Special thnks to chef sandeep kalra and chef rakesh for their hospitality. Must try pepperoni pizza. Outstanding hotel with grt restaurant and lovely people to serve. Overall an exellent experience. Must revist,5
A fantastic team led by Mr.Khare and his team and u can't imagine it's more than 13 yrs old property and kept fantastically clean and spotless be it rooms.. or Resturants or the Bar   Must try the resturants Cilantro and Saffron and I suggest u should leave it to the F&B Team of Shomi and Nikhil to cater the gourmet as per your taste be it Indian or Japanese !   I would suggest take the Pool View rooms and Sidharth wojld ensure u get just as u want and it's just lovely to see the oasis amidst the concrete maze . The bar is the talk of the town and various programs go happening and u can ask an energetic sever Karan to just make the drinks that would suite your mood !    It's as if u would have a holiday as u work !   ,5
I was there at the hotel for just one night. The staff was excellent. They were extremely warm and diligent. Chef Sandeep Kalra made me a customised Pepperoni Pizza and it was the best Pizza I have eaten in a long time. It felt that that the pizza has been delivered straight from Italy. Thank you Trident Oberoi. Can't wait to be back for a longer stay.,5
I happened to visit this restaurant with few of my colleagues for dinner. The food served at Saffron was outstanding and complimented by friendly staff and great service.  They good collection of wines too.  Strongly recommended for nice sumptuous Indian meal.,5
I stayed at this property 2 weeks back and was completely spellbound with the architecture and the upkeep of the hotel. I seriously never expected such tranquility in the midst of Gurgaon.  Cilantro served some outstanding food and pizzas were just out of this world. We were highly recommended by friends to dine at the hotel and it completely lived upto the expectation.  Will surely return soon. ,5
"I just got back today from a fab four night stay at this amazing hotel! The architecture of the hotel is beautiful, very classy and understated yet luxurious!! Gaurav, at the reception was very helpful when we checked in and made sure that we were comfortable in our rooms.The facilities are quite nice, apart from the gym which needs to be upgraded and made bigger and also have better equipment. Food was quite lovely as well and we tried the breakfast buffet which is highly recommended! The waiters do their utmost to make sure each and everyone leaves the place well fed and happy! Food is fantastic and I would like to say that the chefs and his team.are fantastic!I.would highly recommend this hotel to everyone! ",5
"We went there for a one night stay for the Independence Day off to seek relaxation and to our surprise our stay was more than overwhelming. Our room had the most gorgeous view of the pool and all the dome shaped landscape added to the pristine look.   The staff is more than cordial. They're warm and welcoming, makes you feel at home.  Chef Bharti heading the in house Japanese resturant Kanomi, makes the most flavorsome sushi (veg and non veg). It meets and surpasses international standards. She made us a complimentary  appetizer  while we waited for our order since the dumplings were taking some time.   What not to miss : The triple mushroom dumpling, the wood fired vegetarian Primavera pizza, decaf Machiatto.  Chef Kalra, the head chef of cilantro, goes personally to all the",5
"I have been a Trident member for a while and have rarely been disappointed. The Gurgaon Trident is the only one with a resort layout and is grand. The location is not great as it is not in the beautiful parts of NCR but is conveniently within reach of airport, Gurgaon, Vasant Kunj/Vihar/Mehrauli areas. The service is enthusiastic and personal and this creates a whole new experience simply because they have learnt not to make it intrusive. The choice of restaurants are great with the Indian selections being highly recommended. Its modern and non fussy which makes it convenient for travel and business alike. Enjoy ur stay!",5
"most of the time I stayed at westin but for couple of days I stayed at Trident this time. First of all, I really liked the food for breakfast and the most great thing for it was I can order food based on my own personal tastes, waiters and waitress in the restaurant come and ask me whether I like the food and they check every second.  second, I really want to give compliment to house keeping service that trident has provided to me. every day they offer fresh fruits and once or even thrice a day they come and visit my room and asked me whether I have anything in need.  Third, car that they offer me for airport and commute to office was very comfortable.  fourth, Swimming pool and pool bar with wonderful cocktails.  I really enjoyed staying at trident and I look forward to stay",5
Trident Gurgaon is in the heart of Gurgaon but so well landscaped that you feel you are in the greens far away from the city.   This review is about 2 of the Best Chefs in the world :  1. Chef Deep Mohan Bajaj : While he is adept at multi cuisine --- my favorite is the Paranthas that he makes for Breakfast. The Paranthas -- both Aloo Pyaaz and Gobhi are to die for.  2. Chef Sandeep : Same as above -- while is adept with multiple cuisines -- my favorite has been the Goan Fish Curry and Rice. Absolutely delicious. And post that Chef Sandeep's rasmalai is an all time favorite dessert !!,5
"I stayed at this property for a couple of days on a business visit earlier this month and was amazed by the experience that I received from their staff. Their hospitality and friendliness added magic to the calm and serene atmosphere. This property is located amidst the hustle bustle of the city but, the view of the water body at the entrance; takes away all the stress. Thank you, so much. You have been outstanding in your services!",5
"Its a great property and is actually majestic.. With an outstanding staff.. Its neat and clean.. The hospitality is amazing specially the people like Pawan, Gaurav, and Shashi from the housekeeping who made our stay comfortable.. overall staff is good but I do not remember the names as of now so named few.. I would really like to come back!!!",5
"I had a business visit few days ago and this was my first time visit here. As soon as I entered the hotel, it somehow felt great. The architecture is very calm and beautiful. We had a meeting and post that there was dinner. The food and hospitality was great. Surely recommend this hotel.",5
I don‚Äôt know how in the world I missed going to this gem of a place-Trident in Gurgaon in the past few years that I have been staying in the city! Love d property amidst the hustle bustle of the city u enter this quiet n serene place with a big water body in the front and so much greeeeen all around! Just loved the property...with some waterfalls also around d property...! A must visit amongst the 5 stars of Gurgaon.,5
Great place We stayed at the hotel for a business visit to Gurgaon. It has great restaurants and the rooms are world class. The service they provided is excellent in every sense and everybody tried to make us feel at home. If opportunity permits we will go back to the hotel again.,5
"  I would like to outline the care and the kindness of the person who are working at Trident Gurgaon, where they fully try to anticipate any need I could have. I also would like to highlight the delicious food that was proposed to us. Thank you, I hope I will experience this place again.",5
"Stunning Arhitecture,I enjoyed being at TridentGurgaon.The food was fantastic and the property as a whole is beautiful.I willdefinitely be going back and have recommended  this property,thank all my friends and family.",5
"Best property and best hospitality in the busy city Gurgaon. Staff is super cool, energetic and young. They want to make difference and make your stay extremely comfortable. They went out of the way to help to me. Will surely visit again.",5
"My husband stayed here.last week amd thia is his review ""All staff were polite, efficent, professional and very helpful, facilities are well laid out and a relaxed atmosphere. The menus in each of the restaurants  had plenty of options and was tasty. In room dining was efficent and well prepared. I felt very well looked after during my recent stay""",5
There are so many pizza joints in gurgaon however no one can beat Trident Gurgaon pizza !!! Simply love it !! Bestest pizzas in Delhi NCR Must visit if you are in gurgaon   Amazing place  Lovely ambience  Always enjoy dining here,5
"We stayed at this magnificent hotel on our transit from London on way to Sydney, where we live.  It is like an urban resort, the moment you enter the hotel.  Our stay was made even more comfortable by the hospitality and the delicious food served in the Cilantro Restaurant.  Thanks to all who make the Trident Gurgaon such a welcoming hotel. ",5
"Spent a lovely weekend with my family at Trident Gurgaon. Such a wonderful, relaxing experience to be at this pretty hotel which is so designed like a resort. The hotel has a calming influence as you enter, has an amazing pool, very warm and friendly staff who are always willing to go over and beyond to make their guests comfortable. Great architecture, amazing food, Oberoi's special service, what else could one ask for ! Definitely want to be back soon...",5
"I enjoy staying at Trident whenever I travel to Gurgaon. Very friendly people who really want to take care of you and go the extra mile. The property, with large water bodies, smooth lighting and light aroma provide a calm and comforting ambiance. Very relaxing after a long tiring day!! Restaurants - Saffron; Cilantro are top notch. Kudos to the management team and staff for creating the perfect home away from home!!",5
Well i find trident as a perfect place to visit for dinner and lunch with a large group. It is a very fascinating property with a huge pool in the middle with torch lights in the night. Really good hospitality & the food is good in taste at the same time. ,5
"Excellent hotel - felt like a tranquil oasis in the heart of Gurgaon. Staff was extremely courteous and hospitable. The rooms were beautiful and rather large, with a great view of the water features of the hotel. The food was excellent and a large variety to chose from. Highly recommend ",5
"First thing first, it isn‚Äôt anything like a resort. Us three friends booked a suite to spend some time together. The room was great. Modern and comfortable. It had two bathrooms and a nice living area which made the stay fantastic. However, there is no place outside the room where you can walk around or sit in the open. So we were confined to the room. There is a pool which is great but that couldn‚Äôt have been an area for ya to hang out. It just got very boring after sometime. Their bar and restaurants too look tired and uninviting. And the food is just horrible. All the restaurants are a let down. Nothing from the buffet breakfast was close to what they should taste like. The dinner was disappointing. We ordered some room service and were just upset with what was sent. We were",3
"I just came back from a business trip to India. My stay in the Trident Gurgaon was fabulous ! From the time you land in the airport till you leave, you get the nicest treatment from all the great staff - the drivers, reception people, house keeping, waitresses... The hotel is beautiful, the pools gardens and all areas are magical. The food at all restaurants was delicious - Indian, Japanese and Continental.  Recommend warmly this hotel for anyone who visits Gurgaon.  Waiting to come back in my next visit !",5
"You can have various facilities, amenities, features but how you combine them with impeccable service across all your hotel staff makes an experience enjoyable and unforgettable .... that‚Äôs Trident Gurgaon ...   I stayed recently for few days and easily, one of my best stay experiences.  - Property itself is purely magical - in the middle of a bustling noisy Gurgaon corporate jungle, it feels you are in a calm soothing oasis... right at the entrance with the reflection pool to the big courtyard going to the rooms - elements in harmony  - Rooms - Luxurious, spacious, great amenities and marvellous view (at least the pool one) ... it feels that they have worked on the detail with the furnishings and the paintings etc. needless to mention- comfy beds and good bathrooms  - Food -",5
Stayed here for 2.5 days on the way to and from Agra. Friendly staff and very hospitable. The driver picked and dropped us from and to the airport with no issues. They offer a good buffet at breakfast with a lot of variety . The rooms are clean. We had a lovely stay. I would recommend this hotel if u are in the area. ,5
"Trident is undoubtedly a beautiful property with fantastic restaurant. Unfortunately the buffet is infested with flies. The food is unhygienic. I am now worried about my health after having an expensive buffet in the restauarant. The hotel staff accepts the flies as a normal condition.  The hotel might be a modern luxury hotel but charges the patrons for WiFi usage. We guess the hotel is not making enough money from its regular services and is embarrassing india, which is known as the Internet capital of the world.",4
"This is to apprise the visitors of Trident gurgaon.  The property I knew has changed drastically. The Managment is changing and that‚Äôs the biggest factor of crumbling team,lead by their New GM who lacks hospitality and experience which the earlier GM had,and rude department managers like F&B and Housekeeping who are not aware of the services rendered to the guests. The new team is maligning the statement of Oberois which is utmost hospitality to the guest at any situation. Sad to say but not a choice anymore.",1
"Its a beautiful hotel. Hotel is in the city area but will give you a calming experience of being away from the city. As beautiful as in pictures. Beautiful rooms with good pool view. Good food. Pizza and cake were amazing. My spa experience here wasn't good. Being so much expensive, it already sets an expectation for the amazing experience. But I was given the therapy room near to the pool area and it was too noisy. Being your spa time noisy, is the least one would expect. The therapy bed was so noisy that it used to make noise on every momvement. The therapist wasn't so professional either. Overall, it wasn't an experience one would expect from Trident.",4
"Stopped here for the weekend on the way home from 2 weeks in Nepal. Recommended by a mate of mine who has worked in New Delhi. What a place. Staff exceptional, food amazing partic the Indian restaurant, surprise I hear you say but fabulous. The spa and whole experience is one to remember. About the only downside is the amount of growing skyscrapers around it but that probably makes it even more appealing  and iconic. If you get chance to go to this mad and rapidly expanding metropolis stay here.",5
"The Trident @ Gurgaon gives you a superb experience with beautiful landscapes, spacious & well-appointed rooms and very warm hospitality. Good use of water to add tremendous beauty to the opulent architecture. ",5
With my business colleague we had the privilege of having food at Trident Gurgaon.We were served with Fresh Baked Beetroot kebabs they were quite food.Then we were served with Mushroom soup.(it was a bit dinjy) but it was nice.  We took Buffet to avoid looking at The menu and ending up ordering chicken and Daal. The liberty of choosing food from the buffet table is always good.so we took the food and relished the lunch time.  The food is quite good and the best part is the service standards.  Perfect lunch.,4
"I stayed at the Trident about this time last year in 2017, and when knew I had to be back in the city, there was only one place I was going to stay. The hotel is opulent, very well laid out. A great choice of food, both European and pan asian. The room was large and comfortable, facing the pool, and despite arriving at 4.45am in the morning there was a team to welcome us at reception. i really encourage any visitor to the hotel to chat to the staff - who have a real sense of pride in where they work and in how they can make you stay as great as possible. For me this hits the spot, great pool, good food, great service and a warm and friendly place - which they asked me to consider my home when ever I am in Delhi. I hope I wont have to ait too long before I return again.",5
"... i don't mind making my limited exception in favor of Trident, Gurgaon.  Service, cleanliness, ambiance, room and everything in it, facilities and 'that sense of peace and relaxation'... two thumbs up for me. You know me when I make a review... good is good, bad is bad, and this time, it's really good.  My only constructive criticism will be the breakfast buffet. While Indian food is really very rich and tasty, not every customer is fund of spicy viands so it would help if there can be more selection to choose from.  I love the concept of their in-room dining where the chef was so accommodating to listen to you and the way you want your food to be cooked, especially in my case that I am not much of a fun of spices I am not familiar with.  Kudos to the Trident Guragon team.",4
"One of my favourite places to be in Gurgaon. Have been here a number of times and have been disappointed with anything that this hotel has to offer. Cilantro of the best budden spread in the down and Saffron has one of the best Indian food out there. Had a gala time there on the new years eve, rooms were big and comfy overlooking the heated pool supported by a very polite staff.Undoubted the most beautiful hotel in the heart of Gurgaon. ",5
"Gurgaon is well known for its ever-expanding infrastructure, which makes it a concrete jungle that can be overwhelming. The Trident Gurgaon is a little piece of heaven in this harsh environment. The outstanding architecture, complemented by beautiful fountains and gardens, transports you to another dimension safe from the noise and stress of the big city. The rooms are equipped with all the luxury you can imagine and the installations such as the swimming pool and gym are top notch. The service is simply superb. From the moment you are checking in you are already offered complimentary drinks and anything you need to feel comfortable. When you ask for a wake-up call you are immediately offered your favorite coffee to arrive at the time of your wake up. Last but not the least, the",5
Helpful staff and good atmosphere. Outside ambience is wonderful.Cleaniness is mantained. Everyone at the hotel tries to help you. The restaurants need to be better.The food variety at the buffet is limited for the main course..could be better...All in all a nice place for family vacations.. recommended,4
"Have had a long stay here for work and have been extremely well looked after by the wonderful staff including Mamta who helped make my room a home away from home. I've just been brought some lovely fresh flowers to brighten up my room. Can't say enough good things about the food, the room, the service and the staff.",5
"We stayed for my birthday in this hotel. The quality of service, arch design , cleanliness , staff ...everything that you can think of was superb! We were in a suite facing the gorgeous water body that had amazing views of the pool & internal courtyard. The staff was very friendly & courteous. They presented me with a very nice choclate cake as a surprise for my b'day. The breakfast spread was lavish & absolutely yummy. The chefs took so much care to make whatever we wished for. Highly recommend this place to all looking for luxury at it's best!",5
The staff are very helpful and friendly. The hotel has a lovely character and atmosphere. It's very close to Khan Market - walking distance in fact. Plus there's a really nice park for walking only a few blocks away.,5
"So we wanted to get away from our home and stay at a place nearby .. so my husband booked Trident gurgaon. I‚Äôll start with something that stands out from miles , The warm hospitality of the staff , absolutely worth commending , mentioning and praising .. it‚Äôs an inbuilt culture they told us as each and every one of them was so warm, attentive and went out of their way to look after us . They really did make us feel at home . Food at Cilantro made by chef Bharti , especially her Sushi is something to admire and relish - it‚Äôs creative , artistic and loaded with taste.. a treat i would say . Saffron I feel needs to step up by oriental beats everything else.  Morning spread is decent but the chef makes anything as per your requirement and taste. Hotel itself is very well maintained",5
You will love the food here and the breakfast with many Indian delights is a treat. For Non Indians please check what is in offer to enjoy a very traditional breakfast ( don‚Äôt mind the calories ). Rest of the facilities are great and space is a extraordinary feature of this hotel. In today‚Äôs cramped world this hotel is a refreshing exception. ,5
"Everything is just perfect about this hotel. I have stayed here 3 times and I am sure that I will go back again. The food, sleep quality, the pool, the staff and everything is just amazing. It is very peaceful hotel which provides a relaxing atmosphere. Their breakfast is full of variety. The architecture of the hotel is unique and is beautiful. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for high end business and leisure travellers.",5
Only thing is that food is so overpriced. Staff was professional and courteous. Would love to visit again with a great variety of food available. The menu had several options. Nice location and a nice ambience. All in all very satisfied.,5
"I found this to be a great place to stay for many - location, ambiance, facilities, service, food and hygiene. Location is very convenient. I had dinner at saffron restaurant and the food taste was terrific. Options of food and authenticity of the taste is appreciated. I also used gym, can‚Äôt say it's huge, but adequate enough to use without waiting in a queue. All the equipment were in good condition as well. Menu at breakfast is perfect, didn‚Äôt feel like short on anything. Overall a great property and resort like design. A well bought lightness to my trip.",5
In heart of the city this property is sooo close to nature with lots of fountains water pools and every where there is natural light. Hats off to the architect. Great food and a really relaxing swimming pool.,5
Located in the heart of guru gram very close to airport n malls of guru gram . Very beautiful gives u a feel if living in a palace . Nice landscaping . Hospitality is impeccable. Connected to oberois hotel which has nice restaurants n not ti forget a kids pool too. Hotel provides free pickup n drop to ambience mall and to airport also ( check at reception ) . Overall a gem .,5
"Stayed for 7 nights during a work trip. I contacted the hotel a week prior to arrival to book a transfer and the process was seamless. Check in was efficient, and the service though out my week was attentive, but never obtrusive. There was a promotion happening during the month I stayed so the room rate was reduced some what. I felt this represented excellent value and meant I chose this hotel over similarly priced hotels nearby. Location was key as my office was nearby and I didn‚Äôt want to spend hours in Delhi traffic. As a result of being located in the business district and nearby to airport, I would suggest this is more of an business orientated hotel or for those wanting to be near airport but not at the airport. Note location is Gurugram and far from Delhi centre. The",5
"I stayed at the Trident during a recent business trip and had a fantastic experience. The service was exceptional--staff went out of their way to make sure that my stay was as comfortable as possible. Everyone at the hotel were polite and extremely hospitable, ranging from staff at the restaurant, in-room dining, reception desk, bar, spa and the gym; especially Gaurav, Rittika, Shoumi, Suresh, Shubham, Priyank and Bharti Chauhan, who makes the best fried rice outside of Hong Kong. The hotel offers a complimentary drop-off service in a mini cooper, that is very handy for offices in cyber city and nearby metro stations. The limo service is also very good and you are guaranteed a stress-free smooth ride with very experienced, unflustered drivers--a stark contrast to the local taxis",5
"Had a fab business stay. Room was modern and clean, food was perfect but the service and hotel architecture and grounds really stand out. Used the gym and pool and they were both amazing. The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you - first class. Highly recommended.",5
Beautiful property. Extremely attentive staff. Very good for business travelers. Special call out to Chef Deep for an amazing breakfast and great service. All the staff take good care of the guests. Will definitely visit again.,5
It was really a nice stay at Trident Gurgaon. The staffs are so kind and humble and ready to help you in anything. The atmosphere is so beautiful. Rooms are big in size. Bathroom is spacious. The pool is also nice. The night view is awesome. Looks like a palace and castle. The Indian restaurant is also serving delicious Indian dishes. Breakfast is enough and good. Overall they are the best in Delhi.,5
"We visited the restaurant. The service was as expected emaculate. Food was nice. They had Japanese , Chinese, Italian, Indian and Thai options. All were nice. Ambience was nice. Highly recommended for fine dining. ",5
"We went this time to the restaurant. The level of hygiene, presentation and service were excellent. However the food was not great in terms of taste, some of it did not appear fresh to taste. The cold salads appeared to have been waiting too long. Indian preparations were lost between authenticity, fusion and confusion. Risotto did not appear to be Italian ...it was Indian attempt.. For the very high amount of money spent...the food was not that great...can be had at one third in similar ambience. We sat outside and it was cold but the gas heaters refused to wrok.  The expectation from trident is rightfully very high with the Oberoi brand. Unfortunately, this one was not great experience but then it could be an isolated case. ",3
Always enjoy my stay here whenever I have business in Gurgaon. Staff are excellent and always available to assist when required. Good gym and nice pool. Excellent restaurant with great food. Handy drivers from the hotel.,5
"Very modern sleek hotel with professional and attentive staff. Room 208 was very comfortable and had nice amenities. Ate in the Asian inspired restaurant for dinner and sushi was the order. A little pricey for both food and drinks but very tasty and again staff were very good. The pool area is amazing and very nice to relax. We enjoyed our afternoon poolside soaking up the sun and enjoying a few drinks.  Positives were the room, pool and staff Negatives were the drink prices too expensive in my opinion. ",5
"My two weeks at Trident Was spectacular! I‚Äôve traveled and stayed in boutique hotels, resorts all over the world and your normal hotels. The staff and services here out weighs anywhere I‚Äôve been.   From the start of my stay until now, the service remained to be outstanding. Bharti Chauhan-Executive Sous Chef gave special attention to my needs, not for the food but for my allergies! Preparing me Ria-manager in training is absolutely delightful and will perform well in her role and was attentive to everyone who came in. Housekeeping crew was very detailed and thorough in the daily cleaning. They often gifted me with flowers (roses,jewelry tray) and cookies. Inder and Aarti was very professional. The dining room staff worked well together and performed with compelling services.",5
"The ambience of the Trident from its unique and quality architecture gives this Hotel its character. This is surpassed by the dedication and approach of the staff who do everything they possibly can to make your stay an experience. We decided to add a weeks holiday after completing a weeks work in Delhi and my wife flew out to join me. During the day we virtually had the pool and the gym to ourselves. The hotel has very few guests with children and there fore works perfectly for couples.  At night we mostly ate in the Tridents own restaurants, the food and drink were  just perfect. A huge thank you to all the staff in the bar, restaurants and housekeeping who did so much for us.  I have one question; as the Trident  attracts so many business visitors why not put a deal together",5
The manager shamyane is a disaster  - she lied about the category of room - she made my friends leave - she did not have the respect to come and tell us she was not honouring her word  She should be fired. She does not belong in the trident / Oberoi brand,1
"I recently spent a week here on a work trip and this is a really beautiful hotel. From the moment I was picked up by the staff from the airport until the moment I left, the service was impeccable and the experience of a very high standard. The rooms are very comfortable and clean, and a home away from home, especially when you are travelling for work. A big thank you to the staff at the Trident Gurgaon for making this such a wonderful stay. I would happily stay at this hotel again in the future. ",5
"I stayed at this hotel for a business trip and was highly impressed. The welcome, from being greeted at the airport to checking into my room was excellent and the service throughout the stay was top notch. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic, lots of choice, local options, fresh fruit and items to order. They really cannot do enough for you. The restaurants for lunch and evening are excellent as well, but the only downside is that they are incredibly expensive.  The room was lovely, and fresh flowers were put in my room a couple of times during the stay. The gym is well fitted out and the pool area is very nice. It was lovely to relax in the heat during a couple of afternoons there.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5
"After the argy-bargy of downtown New Dehli, this hotel was like stepping on to another planet. I've stayed at some amazing hotels during my career but this one totally made me feel like I was in a dream. Great vibe, lovely service, and beautiful surroundings. If you are going to spend your hard earned cash on a luxury stay anywhere, I cannot recommend this hotel enough! You will not be disappointed. I only wish I was on holiday and not on business! I would have never of checked out :)",5
"I am writing this review because of the breakfast Trident served us. Their buffet ks amazing.   Elaborating from the starting, the hotel‚Äôs location is okay-okay because of too much traffic and population in Gurgaon generally. So not a big fan of the location.   Secondly, the hotel‚Äôs architecture. Its fantastic. The way this hotel is designed is very beautiful. The entrance is amazing, the lobby is great and spacious and the restaurants are beautifully setup. You way to your hotel room will also be worth Instagrammingüòâ.   Third, The room. I stayed in the standard double bed room. It was normal. Like, it will have all the necessary things a 5 Star hotel should have. Not very spacious, but, okay-ish. I loved the shower pressure though üòâ. Haha!  Last but not the least, The",4
"We loved the rooms, the food and the service. We can't brag enough about our stay. It was quite a novel experience to stay in city hotel with an ethnic palace feel. We loved the lit fire torches around the open public areas and the swimming pool in the evening. In the daylight you can see the white birds chirping around in stark contrast to the deep blue reflection pools and the green foliage.",5
"This has to be one of the best hotels in Gurugram and considering it's location in the middle of an industrial zone, you would never guess (or hear/see) any of the hustle and bustle outside its borders. It literally feels like walking into a desert oasis with the decor and the service is simply fantastic. In room service is great along with the food and you even get a complimentary shuttle drop off to a location of your choice when you check out. I had a chance to get dropped off in a Mini Cooper even though I could have just walked to my destination from the hotel. Why give up a free ride? And the pool... yes, that pool... it will definitely make you want to stay and just laze around it all day. Try and pick a room that faces the pool and you wouldn't be disappointed. The rooms",5
"We only stayed for 1 night but we loved it, after days of travelling across dusty Indian cities I thought I would take advantage of the spa and have a Thai Foot massage and it was the best massage ever !!  We ate with our pals as we were on a trip with 10 others, the service, the food, and choice was fabulous, our waiters were anxious to offer us tasters of their wonderful cuisine, which we loved.  Our room was an executive suite with a bathroom to die for and with a view of the infinity pool right outside our bedroom windows.   Thoroughly wonderful stay only wished it could have been longer. Highly recommended",5
Its one of the best properties with Horizontal expansion instead of Vertical. Had a wonderful stay at Trident which was a halt over before visiting Kashmir. The property is spacious. The cool breeze at the pool area made me sleep within minutes. The night view of the hotel is also superb. Rooms are spacious and the hospitality is as expected that of 5 star. We enjoyed our stay to the fullest. Added 2 photos of night lights that i liked the most. ,5
"The Trident has been my first stop in Delhi for many years.  It‚Äôs convenient to the airport for the next day‚Äôs flight.  It‚Äôs elegant and understated.  I always request a corner pool view room and feel I‚Äôm walking on water.  When I first started coming here there were no other hotels in the area.  Now the area is jammed and Trident feels like a very special oasis .  Even though the corner pool rooms are a long walk to the lobby that includes flights of stairs, this is welcome exercise after a 14 hour flight.  Food and service is wonderful.  Great spa with wonderful massages always welcome after a flight.",5
"Such a shame that this hotel has been the only disappointment on our travels. Beautiful hotel, very lavish BUT, it is in a commercial setting with extensive external building works and huge cranes across the skyline. The grounds are kept to a very high standard BUT there is only one small bench and nowhere else anywhere to sit and enjoy them. The restaurant buffet was beautifully laid out with a wonderful choice of international food and the staff could not be faulted for their attentiveness BUT there was a family with five screaming children that were allowed to run riot throughout the restaurant with no restrictions, totally ruined our meal. Then going to to the pool was a total disaster, not a sun bed to be had. Having enquired as to how many rooms were available and being",3
"Beautiful, calm and serene! A place which can't be imagined in the chaotic city of Gurgaon.Good food (tad expensive though!) Coffee is errr okay but the ambience is amazing! Would visit again sooner..",5
I‚Äôm here while my husband is working in Delhi. So here on my own though the day. I have find the staff to be very friendly and helpful I feel comfortable here. The hotel is beautiful and the pool is very clean. There is only one thing and that food and drinks are expensive. I would stay here again. ,5
"It‚Äôs my first time in Delhi.  It‚Äôs pretty nice hotel.  There is only one restaurant in this hotel but the nearby Oberoi hotel has a few descent one, which should belong to the same brand.  The service is pretty good and housekeeping has done a descent job in keeping the room tidy.",5
"I stayed at Trident, Gugaon during my business trip along with other colleagues as the event location was located near by from the hotel.  They organized all the items I requested for in-room amenities. Room is really very spacious and nicely organized.  Breakfast buffet is well spread and good quality.  Hotel is spread over big area and reaching from reception to my room was quite a walk! Lots of trees are planted all over the property and that gives a great feeling in the middle of a busy Gurugram (aka Gurgaon) city!  I'll certainly consider Trident as my first preference for upcoming trip to Gurgaon.",5
"Last December (2017) we visited India and stayed at Trident Hotels at Gurgaon, Agra, Jaipur and Udaipur.  While Trident at Gurgaon was excellent, the others have brought my rating down to average. We stayed 3 nights at each place except in Agra (1 night). At Gurgaon, the hotel is quite new, spacious and well maintained and managed. The staff were very attentive and did their best to please us. THey offered us the hotel car to a nearby mall.  One major complaint, an important one is their Loyalty Program.  This only applies when you book the hotel online with the Trident,  If you book through a travel agent (like we did), you are out of luck. The reason to mention this is not to get any points (these do not do any good for me, Trident is an Indian chain and I do not visit India",3
"Spent our last night night here, shame we didn‚Äôt book an extra night, fantastic end to out tour of India. Ate in the restaurant at night as a large group look after us well, had an early morning flight and we was able to have breakfast before we left lots of choice at breakfast. Used the pool which was freezing but you expect unless heated that it would be, used the gym a fantastic gym a good range off equipment. Rooms again where lovely clean and big. Best hotel we stayed at on our tour. ",5
"As you enter the hotel, it's almost like you've been transported into another world! It's a beautiful beautiful hotel with a palace like feel to it. The staff is extremely polite and service is amazing. My favorite has been the pool facing room always..Definitely recommended to all travelers.",5
"The hotel is well located close to the airport and in Gurgaon ( New Delhi). The hotel has fabulous landscape and very spacious. Rooms are comfortable, the service in general good. Breakfast was excellent and the service was fantastic.",5
"The Trident is a wonderful place to stay. Very clean, very friendly, very comfortable. This hotel feels calm and friendly. Almost like a villa with the open courtyard and beautiful pool area. The Saffron Restaurant at the hotel has the best Indian food I've ever had.  The hotel staff are extremely friendly and make for a very comfortable visit.  The hotel grounds are shared with the Oberoi. They are very safe, clean, and quiet which is surprising with the level of construction and traffic going on just outside. Like a little oasis.  A note of warning, the food and drink at the hotel is good quality and tasty, but quite expensive. Particularly the drink. Wine is outrageous. However, it is just a quick ride over to Cyber Hub or Ambiance Mall and you can have a variety of food",5
Expectation  was more as i had already visited trident agra... Food was a sad part in this hotel and checkinn was not very kind.. Breakfast was very basic. Staff again was friendly and good.. But after check out had to wait for long for luggage and even the car was not parked at the area.. it was away.which was not accepted...  ,3
"The staff and the premises are neat clean awesome and customer focused.  The food quality if very good and while it's on the higher side, it's definitely a quaint indulgence :) One feels peaceful visiting here and you can have banquets and weddings here too that will be sooo sooo memorable!",5
"We recently decided to stay a night with my family in Gurgaon and hence we decided with trident as it has long memories attached. It did go down the fall as the staff in the Restauraunt were not up to the mark, either they are new or has just started in this business which is not expected from a hotel like trident. Due to this there were lots of confusion and slow service. Apart from that, the rooms and service there was good. ",3
"I really have a great experiene in Tridant Hotel and  became a big fun of the Hotel all the staff are really so kind and  make all effort  to you feel like at home , we stay in Dheli and Udaipur and simple we love it and we will recommend for  our friends in Brazil , we would to  thank  specially  thank  to Mrs Anshul Bhatia  so kind  with us by e mail  we love  the Trident Staff  :)",5
Out of the world property...worth a stay..amazingly beautiful water bodies in and around the Hotel..the reastaurant main chef Bharti was ultimately Gd n sweet..the front desk manager Palak n the other staff was courteous and very humble..the lifeguards even were too gd and caring..Gym too was very clean and nice..worth a stay...the hotel was tooo grand n huge...,5
"Found to be a great place to stay for multiple reasons - location, ambience, facilities, service, food, cleanliness, etc etc.,  Very convenient to visit offices in cyber city DLF as it takes Just 10 mins.  Had dinner at saffron restaurant and the food taste was terrific. Met a localite over dinner and the Choice of food and authenticity of the taste is appreciated.  Used gym, can‚Äôt say huge, but adequate to use without having to wait. Equipment‚Äôs are  in good condition aswell.  Menu at breakfast is just perfect, not too grand but didn‚Äôt feel like short on anything. Liked idli the most for the authentic south India taste and texture.   Overall a great property and resort like design brought lightness to my official trip.   Will stay here in my next visit to delhi for sure.  ",5
"Without doubt one of the best hotels I have stayed in across the globe. My third visit, the standards are consistently at the top end, from the welcoming smile and service from the team awaiting you when the car arrives, through an quick and smoothly  handled check-in, and into a lovely room which is superbly well equipped, spotless and very comfortable. This hotel manages to combine all the ""small"" touches to make it a truly wonderful experience - and staying for 7 nights has been a joy.  Very highly recommended and I look forward to staying here again",5
"The looks of the hotel always kills its customer. As it kills me and am really attracted towards each and every moment happened with me in this hotel.A warm welcome with Charming smile of the staffs makes my day sweet then a good food at the restraunt makes me healthy and the co operation from the team makes me happy,overall mt stay was mind blowing nd I really enjoyed each nd EVERY moment..  Thanku  Tridentians. ",5
From the minute we arrived the Trident had every single aspect covered to ensure I had the best possible stay.  All requests were taken care of immediately.  I would recommend this hotel without reservation.,5
We had our business review meeting here and stayed here for 2 nights. The menu spread and the quality of service they provide is excellent. The rooms were clean and we had no complaints at all.   They take great care in all the guests.,5
"This is I think the third time I have stayed at Trident Gurgaon and again I was not disappointed with the service and the friendliness of the staff especially the people I dealt with closely i.e. Sajit (restaurant) and Sanjay (bar) Meher (reception) plus the security staff at the first entrance, they were always ready to open the car door and carry our luggage plus the drivers who took us to Ambience Mall complimentary by the hotel, I cannot wait for my next visit",5
"From initial chauffeur pick up at the airport (amazed he was still there considering my flight was two hours late!) to final departure the service at the Trident is excellent. Staff such as doorman Mohit always greet you with a smile and try to engage you in  conversation about how your day was. Reception staff were friendly and always had a car and driver waiting to take me to work every morning. They would also arrange prompt pickup for me after work when I gave them a call. In addition to arranging drivers to/from work the hotel also arranged complimentary rides to the nearby Ambience Mall. Food at the breakfast buffet offers enough variety to ensure you choices do not get stale even after nearly two weeks. Overall staying at the Trident Gurgaon was very enjoyable,similar to",5
"I travel to India on business annually and for the past three years I have stayed at the Trident in Gurgaon.  It is conveniently located to the airport and my office.  It is a sanctuary within a very busy and loud city.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff.  They are kind, attentive and very pleasant.  Many of them recognize me after my multiple stays.  The rooms are very well appointed and the pool facing rooms have a lovely view.  The water features on this property are fabulous.  They offer a good variety of food choices in their restaurants and I‚Äôve never been disappointed.  I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again next year.  ",5
"This was the last night of a 26 day Itinerary (mostly Rajasthan) before we caught the early Sunday morning long-haul flight home.   Quality Hotel with all mod-cons in close proximity to the Airport (a little over 4 miles away) were the main drivers. We did not want to be back IN the City and have to face the angst of the drive to catch the plane in the morning rush, even if it was a Sunday. Our 4 miles transfer took 27 minutes - grief traffic OUT-of-rush-hour in Delhi is horrendous.  Back to the Hotel - Start off with the whole 'fandango' Passport and Voucher routine. We have a confirmed reservation (and it is pre-paid in-full). I cannot understand it. CCard for incidentals - Yea. Sure, No issue.  Shown to our Room, which is miles away, but gorgeous - large, spacious, very",3
"So we stay at trident every time  we land in Delhi because we have been happy with their service. This time however not so much ..... We called to book for a ride from the airport to the hotel over two weeks prior to the trip. The lady on the other side took my husband's flight number, name, credit information and arrival time just to never send the car. Then when my husband tries to call the hotel in the middle of the night no one picks up. The reason one books a five star hotel is to avoid these hassles after a 17 hour flight .... Fine you never sent the car trident and it can be human error but not pick up the phone  after him five times!!!! Luckily after an hour of waiting at the airport there was a driver from the hotel for another guest and he was able to get a ride or he",3
"We had a team lunch on a weekday and got a good deal also. We were around 25 ppl and took the reservation 1 week in advance.  Their snacks were having limited options but good ones such as Fish tikka , paneer tikka etc.  Mutton biryani was not having tender meat pieces. Fish curry and butter chicken was delicious.  Salad items were fresh.   Pizza option is good as well.   No complentary mocktail.  Very nice ambience.  ",4
"Good ambience , awesome food with reasonable price. Near to Delhi gurgaon Jaipur highway.  Staffs are courteous.  Highly recommended for corporate parties, foreigners visiting Delhi NCR and family get-together.   Must try their Punjabi cusines.",5
"We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is spectacular since the moment you get in, the service is great and everyone is very friendly. After all of the hustle on touristing around India this was such a relaxing place to get back to, really recommend it.",5
"My husband and I spent two nights in the hotel for Christmas and truly had a wonderful experience. The hotel itself is beautiful - very luxe, but still warm and inviting. We ate in both Saffron and Cilantro, and the food was delicious.   However what truly sets this hotel apart from others in the city are the staff - I can't compliment them highly enough. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were treated with the greatest hospitality and professionalism. Special mention to various people who truly made our stay very special indeed - Sanjay, Sagar, Shumi, Tiwari, Manish, Mohit, Karen, and Kuldeep.",5
"Really enjoyed our one night stay as a stopover on our way from Nepal back to the UK. All the many staff we met were very competent, friendly and helpful, the food in the Saffron Indian restaurant was top rate, the room was larger than we had expected and the overall ambience of the place is perfect. What an enjoyable place to come to.  The hotel is only about 25mins from the airport and 20mins back to the airport at the times we travelled. I think it is 9-10km; mainly on multi lane highways. But we didn't find it easy to research the options to get there from the airport (terminal 3), so here they are: - there is a hotel airport shuttle for pick up and set down in a luxury hotel-owned vehicle at Rs3700 plus taxes. This needs to be pre-arranged. Our email enquiry the day before",5
The moment you enter this hotel. It feels you are in heaven. This hotel is very so so beautiful that its beauty cannot be described in words. The rooms are superb with every thing in it. Staff is extremely well trained and always serving with a smile.,5
This hotel is beautiful. It felt very Lux. I had a 3 night stay. Breakfast was included Kebob restaurant was very good. Clean safe. Felt secure. The view was breathtaking as you enter the property. I did not use any of he facilities other the restaurants,4
"I spent one week in Gurgaon, for business purposes. The Trident was a great surprise with its romantic architecture, its spotless amenities, its inviting swimming pool, its very comfortable room, the tasty local dishes in its restaurants and, of course its many very polite and competent staff. The place is secured and the access controlled. Trident is conveniently located in the vicinity of the Cyber City. If your point of interest is not in Gurgaon but in Delhi, for instance, you will need to plan for a long drive.",5
"We stayed at the Trident for 4 nights. Conveniently located near the airport and a good base to explore Delhi and its suburbs. Outstanding service. All the staff went out of their way to help and make our stay comfortable. An oasis of luxury, peace & serenity after a hectic day of sightseeing in Delhi. Bit on the pricey side - but arguably worth it. Recommended.",5
"I was supposed to write this review a few months ago but couldn't find any time. I stayed at Trident Gurgaon in July for 2 weeks. It was a great experience. Beautiful hotel, great food, fantastis service. Most of the staff knew me by name on the 2nd day and knew my taste / preferences. Mohit and Sandeep were especially friendly and helpful. The lady chef at the hotel's Japanese restaurant was also awsome (Sorry I couldn't get her name).They made me feel at home during my stay. It happened to be my birthday during my stay and Trident gave me a surprise with a nice cake in my room. Almost all of the staff I met on the day said ""Happy Birthday!"". Thanks everyone at Trident for such a great experience!",5
"Just returned from a luxurious stay at the Trident. This is truly a stunning and beautiful property, which provides a serene oasis in the heart of Gurgaon. The hotel is also very close to Cyber City (great for restaurants) and to the downtown Gurgaon offices.  I would definitely choose to stay here again - especially because of how attentive and kind each staff member is. I also highly recommend the ""Oasis of Peace"" treatment at the Spa.  Finally, a special thank you to Mohit for always being smiling, helpful and very dedicated to making us as comfortable as possible during our stay.",5
"Hotel is beautiful and very well maintained. Staff was once again highlight of our stay, everyone was really kind, especially the people in the restaurant, just to mention main Chef being incredible with our son! ",5
"Trident, part of the oberoi group, is a beautiful hotel with rooms featuring a view of the nicely maintained water bodies and the open air heated pool. That perhaps is the highlight of this business/leisure hotel. Generally, the service here was very good but with regard to the restaurants ie. Cilantro and Saffron I visited, it was a bit of a let down! More on that in the restaurant specific review.   Mine was a short one day staycation. Check-in was a breeze. We were upgraded to deluxe pool view on the first floor. The room was clean, quiet and spacious with a view of the water body and the pool down below. Bed was king size but a little too soft for my liking.   During check-in, I asked for any specific inclusions that came with the room. I wasn‚Äôt made aware that my room came",4
"We only spent a few hours at the Trident, having booked a room upon arriving from Jodhpur to rest before our 3.30am flight back to London. The hotel is really beautiful and immense. The staff was lovely and upgraded to a very comfortable suite. The food was nice. I would definitely stay here again!",5
"Was here once again on a conference for 2 nights. This property (and the staff across the hotel) consistently delivers a comfortable stay.  My special thanks to the chef Sandeep Kalra who happily took care of my dietary requirements during the say. Other staff Ravi (thank you for the great coffee), Hardeep (for amazing cocktail), Gaurav and Sagar for taking care of me.  If you wish to stay closer to the airport or want a memorable experience, this is the place.   Note that it is expensive than may other hotels aerocity but it is worth the experience if you can afford it.",5
"It was our anniversary and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Team at Trident was so helpful, they even arranged a cake for us. Moreover the property is quite huge and give you a true 5 star majestic experience.",5
"This is my second stay in Trident Gurgaon.  The cleanliness and service are beyond words.  The hotel is well-maintained.  You could see the staffs straying on the carpet along the corridor in the early morning.  The breakfast selection and taste are great.  The staffs are full of initiatives.  The only cons are the massage quality and the water-melon on my salad.  There was a ""spoilt taste"" in the water-melon.    Overall, I am very impressed and would return to Trident Gurgaon. ",4
And again: a perfect stay!!! Sure all luxury hotels are similar - the difference is the attitude of the staff - where it feels like home abroad - that is where a perfect stay is. The location is impressive - the food adorable and well the staff makes ALL another level of experience ,5
We stayed one night before catching a flight back home.   As we were only here for literally 12 hours I had booked a basic room which was very nice and clean and served the purpose perfectly.  The restaurant and bar were averge with good service.  The hotel organised airport transfers which were incredibly expensive given it is approx a 10km/half hour drive (20min in the morning). 37500 rupes each way. I don't know why they can't call a taxi?,4
"Beautiful public areas, small but comfortable room, very attentive staff. Only complaint: outrageously expensive food in both restaurants and no nearby alternatives. Would stay here again, but only for short stay.",4
"I always recommend Trident to anyone around Delhi - beautiful, peaceful - and super well trained staff who work so hard to look after us there, know the guests by name and their preferences, (and we aren't the most easy customers!) they will do all they can to meet our every needs!  Food at Safran restaurant is excellent in particular!  A pleasure to visit regularly! ",5
My wife and I stayed at this oasis and loved every minute.  The service was not to be faulted.  The room was lovely.  The grounds and pool were spectacular.  The restaurants are great (especially the Indian restaurant).  We loved every minute we stayed there.  It exceeded our expectations.  Thank you Trident Gurgaon for a great stay.,5
"Despite the dreadful smog this hotel is stunning visually, particularly arriving in the dark. It is exquisitely decorated and furnished. Our room was pretty good. The only real drawer-back is the absolutely ridiculous price of alcohol. The cheapest glass of sparkling wine ¬£30!!! We are in the international restaurant which was fine. All the staff in the hotel really lovely. Shame about the air conditions impossible to sit outside and even the interior corridors seeped on smog. ",4
once we dined at cilantro. the decor is excellent and service was attentive. the food is overpriced but was tasty.  we had a la carte as buffet spread was not that elaborate. the hotel is well maintained. will surly like to visit it again. ,4
The service in this hotel is fabulous. The entire staff are attentive and focused on making your stay a pleasant one.  The hotel is also located conveniently close to the airport so not much time is wasted in traffic.   It is linked to the Oberon which has great conference facilities. ,5
"A stunning hotel with beautiful swimming pool area and public areas. very upmarket and clean. rooms excellent. The reason for our reduction in rating comes from our dining experience in the main buffet /al a carte ,the al a carte menu was very uninspiring and unappealing.Others in our group decided to eat off site after reading the menu The food available on the buffet was limited of poor quality and variety and appeared to have been there a long time , all dried up.  On ordering a pizza , we were disgusted at its appearance and presentation the topping was sparse and barely hot being added after the main base had been already cooked .  The staff did not appear to be wanting to be serving anyone who did not order anything of a higher price , also if you were not of Indian origin",4
"Was staying here with my family. The customer service from the staff and GM were perfection. The chefs were wonderful and food very tasty. You literally felt like you were at a tranquil resort the moment you stepped inside the gates of the hotel, even though the hustle of gurgaon is right outside. It is very well done and maintained. Thanks for a great stay, we look forward to coming back!",5
An outstanding hotel - relaxing atmosphere supported by large grounds and attractive architecture. Trident‚Äôs staff are professional and friendly and the hotel‚Äôs facilities are excellent. All you could want from a 5 star.,5
"Beautiful business hotel. Incredibly spacious feeling to the whole place. Rooms great, pool area very serene and relaxing. I only ate at the buffet style restaurant and the food was a little disappointing in variety and some of the hot food wasn‚Äôt hot. That aside, exceeded expectations.",4
The facility is gorgeous.  The water features are calming.  I actually felt that the security at the entrance was keeping the place secure.  EVERYONE on the staff was welcoming my entire stay.  No request was beneath them.  I appreciated that there is no individual tipping.  A general tip was accepted for all at the end of my stay.  The massage was a definite MUST DO.  I ate at the restaurant and had room service.  All food was good.  Transportation was easy to arrange.  This hotel has moved the to top of my favorites list.  THANK YOU for a great stay.,5
"Stayed here for a business trip - it was an amazing experience. The staff are so caring and in every step there's someone looking after you. The ambience is great, calm and truly a 5 star experience. Food is also excellent. All in all, 100% recommend for a business trip or even if you wanted some lavish treatment. Won't disappoint. ",5
"Having stayed earlier at the adjoining The Oberoi Gurgaon, expected this hotel to be a ""poor cousin"" - how wrong I was! This Hotel is generously built - has King Sized Rooms and is classy in its ambience. If The Oberoi is marble-glass-steel ""in your face"" poshness; the Trident is its more graceful twin - with an understated but elegant pink sandstone exterior and wood - marble - carpeted interior. The amenities in the generously appointed rooms - having high ceilings - are from Kama Ayurveda and complement the luxury element which one experiences throughout. The ""pool view"" rooms are surrounded by a calm languid blue (due to the tiles) water body all around - a morning meditation session just having that view before you is a joyful experience! But the best part is the people -",5
"Quite honestly the top 5 hotels I have stayed in that consistently meets and beats my expectations every time I stay here.  The customer service is well beyond many of the worldwide hotels I have experienced.  Polite staff members who know everything to make your stay comfortable.  The restaurant options are plenty and choices are abundant.  The hotel grounds are truly marvelous, especially the pool and gym.  I really like the comfort of the bed and rooms, everything smells so nice here and they do a great job keeping the hotel looking amazing.  ",5
"This was my first trip to India and I was expecting some chaos to get from the airport to the hotel ... the arrival at the Trident brought a immediate sense of calm to chaos that surrounds the place.  The reception and check in was handled professionally and efficiently ... at 1am you don't want much fuss.  Overall, the service was excellent. The staff are very friendly and well trained. Everything seems to run very smoothly within the hotel. The staff were also very helpful when my driver encountered a problem by taking me to my destination without any fuss.  I enjoyed the food at breakfast as it was very easy to have a healthy breakfast at the extensive buffet. The bars were nice places to enjoy a drink and have a decent business conversation.  Once you exit the gates of the",5
Beautiful hotel - you feel as if you're at a resort although you re in busy gurgaon. It didnt feel like corporate hotel at all. You also have access to Oberoi facilities next door. Great staff and food. Everyone is flexible to meet your needs. Fully enjoyed this stay back in august.,5
Its a beautiful property right when you enter Gurgaon. Cant imagine such a place considering the Chaos and Traffic just outside and that doesn't bother at all. The Hotel is majestic right from the entrance. The place gives you a feel as if you are in a Arabian desert. The staff is really good and the rooms are beautiful and spacious. We stayed here for a night and didnt feel like moving out.,4
"A stunningly beautiful hotel with amazing fountains (that are lit in the evenings to make a peaceful and romantic setting), grand dome ceilings and garden areas. It is a very large hotel so can be quite a long walk from your room to the bar/swimming pool/dining area. The hotels caters well to both Indian and western travelers with 2 restaurants. The hotel very much has a 'business' vibe to it and feels more like a business hotel than a place for couples or families. However, it is only a short distance away from the airport.",4
"one of the most striking features of trident gurgaon are the almost 15 foot high doors. the red monochrome dome looks nothing short of dramatic at night with all the subdued accent lighting. i suggest diners must drop by at least once on a late evening to see the awe-inspiring beauty of the place. food wise it is ok, nothing exceptional, but service is great. i've tried some of the italian dishes and morning breakfast out here. prices are not a rip off, but still on the higher side.",5
This is amazing hotel and extremly nicely maintained . The place is very well maintained and food is really good too. Staff is very courteous and graceful. Location is prime in gurugram and options to choose from room and food .,5
"Great location. Easy reach of airport and cyber city, so plenty of restaurants close by (free drop off by hotel, and you can walk back - although there is one difficult road to cross).  Hotel food is excellent. Rooms of a good size. Swimming pool lovely.  Only criticism is rooms could be better sound proofed both from each other and the corridor.  Nevertheless, the quality of the staff more than made up for that. Perhaps the best trained I've ever experienced in India.  Incredibly helpful. ",5
Even though this hotel is behind a busy route it is so quiet. Sitting by the tranquil pool is very relaxing.  The rooms and staff are lovely. The lady who cleaned my room left me a lovely note and gift.  The restaurants and bar are very nice. We ate in all of them and would do so again.   As this was a work trip I used the wifi quite a bit without any difficulties.,5
"I absolutely love this place. It's spacious and provides a quiet retreat after a hectic travel schedule or a full day of meetings. The staff are very professional, service minded and cater to all your requests. Having stayed here before, I know that the even the standard rooms are clean and spacious. This time I had the pleasant surprise of being upgraded to the presidential suite., which was absolutely amazing. Too bad it was only for one night. Upon a next visit of the Delhi/Gurgaon area, I'll definitely be staying here again.",5
"This is my first trip to India and we stayed at the Trident towards the end of the trip.   When I first saw the place, it looked like it came out of a Star Wars set. But as you enter the lobby and head down to the swimming pool, it's a new world altogether.   We had a pool-facing room with floating frangipanis. I literally felt I was in paradise!   But what really made this place so special was the outstanding hospitality that I received right from the start. Especially from the doorman Mohit, who makes the effort to engage you and he will do almost anything just to make your stay as comfortable as possible.   Thank you for everything!   ",5
"Stayed here on a business trip with a colleague, and enjoyed every moment of it. We did not have to lift a finger whilst in the hotel, the food was amazing and the staff very friendly and always greeted us warmly and professional.  We did not have a chance to enjoy the pool as were too busy, but in terms of value very good, and very deserving of a 5 star rating.",5
"- went for a business trip, stayed for 4 nights - the property is just amazing, very nicely done - great facilities (conference rooms etc.) - service and staff are wonderful, great food, great drinks/bar, wonderful ambience - wifi was average speed - room lighting could be better, not enough light for a business traveler to do real work  overall, this is a winner, hands down the best hotel in the gurgaon area (have stayed at westin, leela and others, they don't compare)",5
The rooms were full and knowing that I would not prefer a twin bed they upgraded me to Oberoi. Although the upgrade was done I personally prefer trident Gurgaon over its superior Oberoi. Great staff and excellent service. During my last stay their house keeping head ms. Neerja so very courteously came to resolve a minor issue and she made sure that the stay was delightfully remembered. Their Japanese chef Bharathi made an excellent vegetarian udon version and took me through the benefits of the Japanese cuisine.  Worth every word of praise. Keep it up trident. ,5
"Stayed at Trident,Gurgaon for four days for family leisure visit. It is unique,serene,calm and tranquil. Awesome architectural gem created with Moroccan and Thai sensibilities.The elegantly sculpted building fuses best bits of elements of Earth and Trees to create that exotic mythical world ,filled with immense comfort,tech and luxury,adorned with calm deep-blue reflection pools. This stuff of dreams is further enhanced by famed,legendary,top of the Pyramid,astonishing amount of The Oberoi Hospitality with plenty of soft skills.The Oberoi Hospitality is most intuitive and exotic and rarest around the globe. Rooms are extremely beautiful,comfortable and relaxing.Housekeeping is extremely well synchronised ,efficient and courteous.I would like to name housekeeping team members who",5
"I came on a business trip to Gurgaon and stayed seven nights at the Trident. I was picked up by a limousine from the airport and cold water was served to me. It was a nice way to arrive in this hot and humid place in August. Arriving at 1 am in the morning, I was not expecting anything. But instead I was greeted by many hotel employees. The irritating yet exciting experience of the whole place is, and this kept going on every single day, that every single employee gives you a ""Namaste"" any time you pass them: you instantly feel in heaven and well taken care of. The hotel is unusual in its architecture style. It feels like a dessert mansion (by its sand stone) which spreads around indefinitely. The main building has a bar, three restaurants and a huge lobby, where you could sit",4
"this is my second time in Trident , vey nice staff , very clean hotel , but they need to work on their food options and expand it to satisfy different tastes . I will certainly go back again if anytime am in Delhi",4
"Unless you have looked beforehand, you will be stunned with the massive architecture as you are guided to reception(even more astounding at night).  Dehli does not exist here.  Inside are towering ceilings and designer appointments that tell you it is special.  The hotel is a part of the Oberoi organization and actually adjoins the Dehli Oberoi.  All rooms are on one level, with  a pool, spa, and small restaurant down some stairs from a courtyard.  Rooms are spacious and well appointed.  Staff will attend to every need.  The hotel bills it self as a ""no tipping"" affair.  There is a large dining room with an astounding buffet choice or a la carte. The bar, which can be very busy, has a menu, and there is a specialty Indian restaurant.  I  stayed twice on a tour changeover and was",5
"Decided to head to the Trident for a brunch on a gloomy rainy sunday,all that gloom was gone as I was greeted by friendly and courteous staff,lovely change of menu,perfect ambience, to top it all a live band all that added to a perfect and relaxing Sunday brunch at the Cilantro in the most beautiful property of Trident Gurgaon.l left singing and humming a melody to a Sunday afternoon well spent.",5
"The service we received was absolutely outstanding, the front office staff was friendly and courteous, and willing to help in anyway they could. The best however was the service, wonderful lady Ms. Akanksha made us feel very welcome and quite at home. She assisted us throughout the whole event. Big ups to the whole team of Trident, Gurugram. :) ",5
"Absolutely the best hotel in Gurugram and one of the best in Delhi. I have stayed here several times and the quality and service is consistently fabulous. Check-in/check-out procedures are quick and seamless. Staff are incredibly warm and accommodating -- some of the best in the world. The property itself is stunning. From the moment you walk in, to the rooms themselves, you feel like you are in a different place. Special mention to the lobby team and management team, and the ever-friendly and faithful Mohit who is a permanent fixture in the lobby with his incredible warmth and service.",5
"I have always been fascinated by the grandeur of Trident at Gurgaon. It's not intimidating due to sheer size but the concept of personal space is imbibed deep into architecture design and layout. The lofty heights majestic corridor & sense of expand outside is awesome. It almost makes you feel to be in a resort. The restaurant has the same principle. It is a nice balance between completely secluded sit out and a normal distance. It's somewhere in between. The food is ok, but the cutlery the service the charm & grandeur of the place makes it special. You can actually sit down unwind relax and have a leisurely meal with business colleagues or near n dear ones. Altogether, it is worth an experience.",4
"We only stayed a few hours between flights but wished it could have been longer. Service is of the highest quality, rooms are luxuriously furnished and bathrooms are ultramodern. The hotel is fairly close to the Indira Gandhi Airport but not close to many other attractions. Absolutely nothing to complain about.",5
"Rooms are comfortable, service is outstanding, the complimentary car to the Ambiance Mall is a great addition. Excellent fitness suite, great restaurants. Expensive but you get what you pay for. Highly recommend this hotel.",5
"The service standard was immaculate, including from staff Prachi, Vinushi and many others whose names I unfortunately forgot to take note of. They were most polite, attentive and tried their best to anticipate my needs during my 3-night stay. The hotel room came with a beautiful pool view. The deluxe room was spacious, comfortable and luxurious. The breakfast buffet was of high quality. I especially loved the masala dosa. They even have high protein egg white omelette in their menu. Great value for under USD200 per night inclusive breakfast (with free upgrade). It's a pity I didn't have time to use the pool and spa treatment facilities. They looked very inviting!",5
"Stayed for a few days before a trip to Jodphur and as an ex regular the hotel has maintained its high standards throughout. We were upgraded to a suite (many thanks) and everything was great, Cilantro is still good and with a new menu. Food was a bit slower than i remember but we were not in a hurry. Very few of the staff from when i was a regular visitor 18 months ago still remain except the young man who used to hold the doors open for guests but now works front of house (Rohit, ? who has recently had a baby) who greeted us like long lost friends, which was lovely. Sitting around the pool is lovely with water and cold towels provided by attentive staff but at the weekends, especially Sunday the work crowd arrive and mobile phone use is rife. I really do not want to listen to",4
Amazing property which is well maintained.. very good front desk staff.. specially gaurav.. amazing breakfast pool and spa..rooms are also very modern n well maintained. Spread over 7 acres of land.. some golf carts would be ideal ,5
I stayed here twice in May and June 2017.  Definitely has a 5 Star and new feel about the place and very well maintained.  About 30 minute from DEL airport so a nice option if you are flying in or out and want to be close.  They also offer day rooms subject to availability if flying out early AM.  Property:  Expansive (to the point of almost being wasteful given the limited land in Delhi) and feels like a royal compound.  Marble and high ceilings throughout and various water features and nice large outdoor pool located centrally in the hotel compound.  Rooms are located around the pool area and it can be a bit of a walk to and from the lobby to your room.  Restaurant and Bar:  Really nice bar just off the lobby with specials and happy hour pricing on select drinks.  Restaurant,4
"This place sure does have an amazing ambiance, full marks for the structure and ambiance but they served me Kurkurre with Drinks and veg starters in the form of Paneer Tikka was also not good so cant vouch for the food but worth a visit once.",5
"I have to say I have travelled all over the world and whilst I thought the service in Singapore and Thailand was excellent, I had not yet visited India, the team at the Trident are beyond good, not only is the service, food, room, pool etc first class the guys and girls are really genuine and go out there way to make your stay as comfortable and hassle free as possible.  The attention to detail and the selection of cocktails expertly mixed and served by Hitmanshu at the lobby bar should not be missed, equally if you want to know where to go in Delhi, Gaurav is a wealth of information whilst also providing first class service in the restaurant alongside his team, I will definitely be back.....",5
"I loved  my stay there. Everything was great, clean and comfortable.  They could do better with food for people with dietary requirements. I struggled to get the food that met my fructose and gluten free dietary requirements.  Overall. A recommended place.",4
"I stayed for 2 nights for a business trip. Everything was flawless..right from check in process, room and service. Food was delicious and a wide choice for breakfast. The staff certainly know the meaning of hospitality. Would definitely recommend it highly!",5
"I stayed here over two weeks and had really amazing time here! Very good dinning, friendly and wonderful service  and especially  housekeeping went well above and beyond: special thanks to Kamran who made my stay in Trident really convienent. He quickly noticed what I like and what my habits are and I always had what I need in my room: fresh bananas, enough bottles of water and never disturbed me on weekends! Really recommend!",5
"The Trident Gurgaon is a good hotel, well equipped and the rooms have all you require however not as large as the neighboring Oberoi.  Saying this it‚Äôs a business hotel with a solid selection of food and beverage outlets.  The in-room dining and housekeeping were excellent, though the general service at reception, the restaurants and the business centre need serious attention, it is like for many of the staff their first day and or just no supervisory control.  I was approached by the General Manager as I had fed this back during my stay and he was very appreciative of the observations.  I will be returning, as the good well outweigh the not so good, I trust all the feedback will be taken on board and my next visit will see a dramatic improvement.",3
"This is an oasis in the chaos that is Delhi. The hotel is a beautiful building, the staff are friendly and attentive; the food is divine.  You must try the basil martini! I could not recommend this more highly. Wonderful.",5
We stayed at 3 nights Its Awesome property room size is good.. Service Excellent... Food is delicious. We really enjoyed at trident gurgaon. land scaping class. wherever you sit you feel its good. Swimming pool is excellent. It give you WOW feel. we visited this property on 23rd November 2016,5
"I have probably stayed here on about 30 occasions in the last six years, which speaks for itself. It has always been a great place to stay and the service levels are outstanding and incomparable. Consequently I have not had any reason to write any further reviews until now, following my encounter with Himanshu in the Lobby Bar. I had met him on my second and third night when he served me in the lobby bar and on the fourth night I visited during the cocktail happy hour, instead of doing the sensible thing by going to the gym. I looked through the menu and wasn't sure what to have, when Himanshu recommended a whiskey sour which was not listed. It was fantastic and I happily trusted him with the follow on drinks, none of which were on the menu. The cocktails were amazing and I'm",5
"This hotel is just 20 min driving from my place in Delhi and I booked it for two nights for my husband's birthday.This hotel occupies huge territory which is kept very clean, accurate and elegant.  Our room was on the ground floor facing the woter body and what a view it was! Our room was spacious with huge bed, cute sofa, working desk, fully stocked mini-bar and gorgeous (also fully stocked) bathroom. There was also a fruit basket which was refilled daily. Toilettries in the bathroom are simply amazing, very high quality.  Being in expat, I always struggle with switches. Thankfully, it was written whether switch is on or off, so it made my life so much easier :D Thank you for this, it is so thoughtful! Staff is very polite, smile and friendly. All in all, it was very relaxing",5
"I recently stayed at the Trident in Gurgaon while visiting Delhi. The hotel is stunning, everything is immaculately kept, from the lawns to the pool and the rooms. The service is outstanding as well, everyone in the hotel is so friendly and helpful. They really go above and beyond in making you feel comfortable. My husband and I ate at one of the restaurants while we were there, Saffron, which was absolutely amazing. All the daals they served were flavorful, and the lamb was super tender and juicy and the curries were on point. They also offer free yoga classes in the morning, which I was able to take advantage of. If you are planning to visit Delhi, this hotel in Gurgaon is a bit far, but the hotel provided a driver each day I wanted to go out that took me into the city, and",5
"Very nice hotel , excelent amenities . I stayed one night bur i enjoey the hotel very much . The breakfast , the restaurant, the pool , the room wherr impecables. And the service too , very kindfull . Great !",5
We stayed here with our kids. The rooms were great and the service was one of the best we have had. The kids really enjoyed the pool and outside space. They also rexeived so many toys! The food was also good. We would recommendthis place for a stay. ,5
"I've been staying at the Trident for business over the past several years and have just gotten around to writing a review.  For my purposes (i.e., near the office complexes, close to the airport, near numerous eating/entertainment options), the Trident nails it. Hospitality seems to be their defining characteristic and it is always a pleasure to spend some time here.  Within the compound, which also included their sister hotel The Oberoi, it is like an oasis from the surrounding madness of Delhi/Gurgaon. Food options are plentiful and delicious between the two hotels.  Whether for business or pleasure, rest assured that the Trident is a solid choice when staying in Gurgaon.",4
"Having stayed at the Oberoi at other locations, I must say that this hotel is perhaps the best that Gurgaon has to offer. All the way from service to food to the room view and the outstanding Trident service experience. The hotel seems like an oasis in Gurgaon and has a great pool a very professional gym and great breakfast. The sous chef did take personal care of his guests even at Breakfast which is something I was pleasantly surprised with.  The staff were courteous even at 3am in the morning and after learning that I had a long flight behind me upgraded my room as well, to which I must saw wow.. never expected the thoughtfulness of the on duty manager.  The rooms are well equipped, fast Internet and the bed was just perfect.  Overall would I go and stay here again ...",5
"This has been our third time to India, our first to this magnificent hotel. From the moment you enter this property, its very evident that you will have a wonderful stay ahead of you. The decor is beautiful, the location ~ perfect. Whether you are there for romance, business or just to savour the ""Trident Experience"" - no doubt you'll leave with the notion that you will return - as we are already planning to do!!üòÅ Thank you to all at the Trident for a wonderful experience, especially to Subhashree, who always had a smile & went over and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful time. Your kindness & professionalism embodying that Warm Indian Welcome we've come to know. Our stay in the Trident ~ Our, from India, with love...üòÅ",5
"My husband and I stayed here for a one night stop before flying home.  The hotel was very contemporary, with a luxurious feel.  The room and bathroom was a good size, and spotlessly clean and modern. The staff were all friendly and professional.  So, all was good but we would not stay here again because it was not possible to have a quiet drink in the evening in the public areas.  We went to the bar and the music was so loud (and thumping) that we couldn't even speak to each other.  We moved out to the walkway area but, alas, the music was inescapable.  We did have dinner in Cilantro and it was very good indeed with excellent service.  This hotel is probably best for young people or those  on business.",4
Lovely and outstanding place to stay! Excellent service and hospitality by staff! Out-of-the-world facilities! Really loved the stay there and would recommend to all my friends. Thanks Trident for the excellent service!,5
"We chose the Trident for its proximity to the airport (20-30 miutes). We were very pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Modern, cool architecture, very efficient, very clean and with great staff. Cilantro restaurant was excellent and the staff there really keen to help. Excellent buffet in the evening. Unfortunately the very recent law changes (in April17) meant that they couldn't serve alcohol in the hotel (being 500 metres from a main road!). This even captured the mini-bar! Hopefully this will get sorted soon - if not BYOB! ",5
This property is great place for a weekend getaway really quite and clam place and once you are inside the property you will be not feel as if you are in a city it gives a resort feel. Property is not very big but the service is excellent. Never say No Attitude..must experience,5
"Walking onto the property was like taking a step into one large zen garden.  Quiet, tranquil.  The best service ever experienced from the airport transfer driver to the servers to those who watch to ensure they open the door.  Downside?  It falls under the new alcohol sale and consumption law at the state and federal level given it's proximity to a state / federal highway so the hotel is completely ""dry"" including bars, dining and in room mini bar.  Not their fault but I detracted a star as a result.",4
"Stayed here again last month and had another perfect stay.  The hotel is beautiful and can't be faulted but what makes this hotel so special are the staff, they are all wonderful.  They really can't be faulted, they are attentive but not over the top and if you take the time to talk to them you'll find out how great they are.   I can't wait to return to this amazing hotel.",5
"Without doubt,  this is one of the best hotels that I have stayed in. Meals a tad expensive,  but heyho. Approach to the pool was fantastic.  My room was lovely and the bed eminently 'sleepable'! For me, however,  the best part was the staff - so friendly and helpful.  A place I'd love to visit again.",5
"We stayed here for only 1 night after an overnight flight from London and before going on to Amritsar. Luckily we had early access to our room and had a brief but nice lunch in the Cilantro restaurant. The facilities were excellent with a good pool area and gym. In the evening we ate in the Japanese restaurant and had a very nice meal. The hotel was very quiet, possibly because of 'Holi' festival. Staff were very professional and pleasant and if we are back this way we'll remember this hotel and stay here again.",5
"I fell in love with India because of this hotel, where I stayed several times during the past 7-8 years. It is definitely the best hotel I ve been to in Asia- where it is well known the quality is much higher than the same 5* in Europe or US. The staff is impeccable, they were really taught about customer services. Breakfast is delightful and so is all the food in the Main restaurant( I haven't tried the Indian one but people said it s great too). The fragrance on the hallways gives a very luxurious feeling when you go out of the room, the pool is lovely and so is the water in front of the rooms. I chose India for my honeymoon as well because of the great impression I had staying here. The spa services are also 5*, I can t say anything negative on Trident Gurgaon. I also stayed",5
"When I'm in Gurgaon, I stay either at the Oberoi or the Trident, depending on availability and rates at the time. The Oberoi is spectacular, but I always thought I preferred the Trident.  It's smaller, more intimate, and has an incredible pool area.  Service is exceptional, as it is at any Oberoi-owned property.   After my most recent stay (December 2016), I have to say I'll default to Oberoi whenever possible until they refresh the rooms at the Trident. My room was terribly musty and smelled of mildew.  This is very rare for an Oberoi property, and as I am allergic, I immediately alerted management.  Their solution was to put fresh flowers in my room every day; a nice gesture, but it didn't fix the problem.  Engineering didn't find the problem, so housekeeping added in a",4
We had a wonderful stay at the Trident. The pool area is really unique. This is a great place to relax after a long flight. Very nice people have taken care of ourselves. The breakfast place in the garden was very nice and the buffet very special and made with love. We had a garden view room but next time I would definitely take a pool view room. I had great luck to be able to check in already at 9 am to recover from the flight. Thanks for this special service.I also used the hotel shuttle service from the airport and was very welcome. I can definitely recommend the Trident.  ,5
Stayed at the Trident for three nights. The service was impeccable. There were staff at every entrance to assure of your  every needsThe grounds were well kept. The dining was of top grade Indian cuisine,5
"We had a brief dayroom stay;  I had asked to take my own carryon, but they insisted on delivering it.  We arrived at 5:00 (six of us), slow check in, and luggage delivered at 5:35.  My carry on was not locked, and money disappeared.  With only an hour stay (plane was late and bad traffic), we had little time to repack and shower. From what I saw, it looked like a luxurious hotel, but the service was poor.",2
Stayed here for a work related trip but was disappointed that to begin with they allotted a twin bed to me whereas mine was a single room so I changed my room to a kindly my size bed single occupancy. To top it all when I woke up the next morning there was water flowing out of the bathroom due a bad leakage. I was going to slip but balanced myself on time. The leakage was fixed. However disappointing to say the least. ,2
"The facility is stunning, with two massive water features and a 40' ceiling in the lobby.  Many of the rooms look out on to one of the water features, which offers some beautiful sunset reflections. This is a perfect location for quick access to the airport.  Once you enter the grounds you have no idea that you are in the midst of this huge, busy city.  It's quiet, relaxing and accommodating.",5
For those coming in at night or departing early morning it is hard to imagine a better choice of a hotel. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. The staff is efficient and uniformly pleasant. The overall setting of the building (and pool) is lovely. I would return without hesitation!,5
"One of the best hotels I have stayed at; magnificent setting, beautiful decor; as a swimmer I am always looking for a good pool to swim in; this one is 30 metres long and beautiful. dinner buffets in cilantro restaurant were on the pricier side but absolutely top quality and great variety.  If I had to pick a negative it would be that the local seemed removed from the sites and where you would want to be.",5
"This sprawling oasis of green and blue will make you forget you are in gurgaon. The rooms, the views, and the legendary Oberon service‚Äîall are first rate. How can I not mention the hotel's red mini that gave us a complimentary drop to nearby Cyber Hub? Perhaps the only place it could do better in is their food. Full disclosure, we only ate the complimentary breakfast. Maybe their other restaurants have better food.  All in all, an unforgettable and beautiful experience. ",4
"First thing that strikes you is the very impressive entrance to the hotel. You depart the dirt and madness of the street and enter a dubai-esque setting with large open expanses, and a massive dark reflection pool with fire pits at its center. It's quite impressive how they have effectively blocked out the city.  The second thing that's strikes you is the incredibly service minded staff throughout the hotel, not in the least at check in in the relaxed white marble lobby.   The rooms are good and do not show the age of the hotel, which I believe is 12 years.    The bar is nice,- and the food there is quite good. The only negative during my stay was the abundance of aggressive mosquitoes everywhere,- though thankfully not in the room.   It's so easy to go wrong with hotels in",4
"Another highly enjoyable stay at the Trident. The service, as usual, was at a very high standard and the restaurant, bar and communal areas were immaculately maintained.  Check in and check out was very efficient - this is not common for all hotels in the region. We had an excellent Indian fusion meal at the sister hotel which was just three minutes walk through the complex.  One minor point for management to pay attention to - one of the electrical fittings was becoming  loose and so care will need to be taken with maintenance.",5
"Business in Gurgaon brought me to the Trident hotel after transferring from another nearby hotel.  I was in awe of this place from the moment I arrived at the hotel gates!  It's amazing to think such luxury sits in the middle of Gurgaon's hustle and bustle.  It's conveniently located if working at the DLF Cyber City Hub, which saved time getting to and from work.    I stayed at the Trident a number of times and was never disappointed.  I was upgraded to a room that overlooked the pool on my first visit, which had breath taking views and then standard rooms after that, which were beautifully presented.  If you like to exercise, Trident's gym looks out onto the swimming pool, which makes for a much more pleasant workout experience.  I also managed to book myself in for a Trident",5
"My first trip to India.  I'll admit for work not necessarily pleasure.  But this hotel makes me want to come back to India as soon as I possibly can.  I cannot say enough about the staff and service here.  In chatting with the hotel manager he made the comment, ""we can build a 5 star hotel but it's the 5 star employees that make it happen.""  Boy does he have that right!",5
A true 5* hotel. Nothing is left to chance. Everything is catered for both in the rooms and the hotel facilities. My son and I only stayed for one night at the end of our Indian tour but it was a wonderful end to a wonderful holiday. Highly recommended.We ate in the Indian speciality restaurant and both the food and the service was excellent...a real treat.,5
We stayed twice in the last 10 days and on the second occasion got an upgrade from a garden room to an upstairs pool view room. Both had all the amenities. The hotel is beautifully designed and the service is exceptional. The only slight niggle is the cost of food/drink in the hotel - Nearly top end London prices . Never the less a great place to stay if you want class and aren't counting the pennies too much ,4
"Having stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world, I can state that this is one of the very best. By all measures, it receives an excellent rating: Staff service, food, cleanliness, unique architecture, room amenities, friendliness, comfortable beds, quiet rooms The facility is absolutely stunning. In addition we were invited to meet the hotel management at an evening garden cocktail party; which of course was very well done. I will make a point of insisting on staying at Trident hotels in the future whenever they are located at one of my destinations",5
"We were booked into the Oberon in Delhi but our tour operator upgraded us to a junior suite in the next door sister hotel, the Trident.  The room and service was exceptional, the breakfast buffet had everything you could wish for, we had an in room meal which was lovely and a meal in the Indian restaurant that we did not enjoy as much, but that could have been because the setting in our room was so nice. We had a massage which was nice but not the best, we had wanted to use the steam room but it wasn't working properly and you could only use it at the time of your treatment. The staff are really professional and helpful. The stay was an immensely enjoyable experience.",5
Excellent property. Its beautifully built with a touch of Thai and middle eastern architecture. Their staff is what makes Trident stand out. They pay so much attention to details and your personal preference. Undoubtedly my first choice.,5
"This  is one of the most beautiful hotels I have have stayed, the ambience, peace, and tranquility make this a very special place. The service is fantastic and the staff so polite, warm and friendly. It was a welcome relief staying here as it's out of the hustle and bustle of Delhi and a short ride to the airport. Everyone I came across were so happy to help in anyway they could. The food is fabulous, particularly the saffron restaurant where they serve delicious Indian food. I also had a wonderful massage, definitely worth treating yourself. I really hope I am fortunate enough to to stay in this wonderful haven/hotel again.",5
I had visited for a business meet and the services were very good with very well maintained convention centre. The food were perfect for a long all day meet with the coffee being a lifesaver.Cheers to the Trident brand.,5
Architecturally modern and appealing.  Very well run; a top hotel and conveniently close to the airport.  The restaurant is another reason to go back.  We arrived in the night and departed before dawn.  The hotel gave us a box lunch and something to nibble on in the mean time.  The one time I did see it in daylight showed how attractive it is.,4
"This hotel is sleek and modern with gigantic decorations to fit the soaring spaces in the lobby and grounds.  Everything is clean and bright and extremely comfortable. The beds are comfortable, and there's enough seating (which isn't always true) in the rooms to be comfortable.  There are infinity pools around the grounds, and a large one for swimming. Although it was rather cool for swimming in February.  The breakfast buffet was the best we had of the seven hotels we stayed in on this re were western, Indian, and Asian specialties offered. The coffee was even quite good. The hotel is only about 15 minutes from the airport, so perfect for a late night departure.  Highly recommend.",5
"If I could give Trident a 6 star rating, I would. Everything from start to finish was outstanding.   Staff: Everyone in the staff was helpful and accommodating. They were flexible in our early check-in (much appreciated after an overnight flight), helped coordinate with our tour group, and were always available for questions. All Hospitality majors should spend a semester studying abroad in India at a place like Trident because the level of service was unmatched.  Breakfast: The selection was excellent. Not only did they have anything a guest could possibly want, but they went above and beyond to make the experience as pleasant as possible. Deep Moran Singh Bajaj, the head chef, personally addressed questions regarding all of the rotating fruits, made recommendations, and went",5
Stayed overnight at the hotel. Absolutely lovely. Had a great body massage & facial. The therapist gave me an extra 1/2 hour free which was added to the 90 minutes planned. She had picked up that muscles were tired after 13 day trip to Gujarat. The hotel is surrounded by water which makes one feel totally at peace with the world. It is only 15-20 minutes from the International/ domestic airports,5
"My 6th visit, nice people, nice room, Great food. Spacious. Although I am working it is relaxing. This trip I have been sick in my room for one day. The front office called me twice and asked me if I needed anything if they should call te doctor. I did not. need any help but it felt good the be looked after.",5
"This was the third and final Trident hotel that we stayed at during our 'Golden Triangle Tour' and whilst the other hotels were good, the Gurgoan is outstanding.  The exterior and public areas are impressive, almost palatial and the bedrooms stylish and comfortable.  The food is good with an excellent choice and whilst this part of India is noted for its vegetarian dishes, there was even a decent chicken/mutton content in the meat curries, rather than the few bits of bones too common elsewhere.  But our over-riding memory will be the ever helpful, friendly, efficient staff who could not do enough for us. Maybe they were a little too intrusive at times but better that than feel neglected.   The grounds with their shimmering pools are impressive, too",5
"Staff in the hotel is very flexible and helping in nature . Room was comfortable and room service was excellent ,,,,I highly recommend this place for value for money and one of the best services,wifi services was really good inside the room and wish all the best for this new chain of hotels.",4
"have stayed here twice on business trips, both times the quality was very high. From the staff, rooms, breakfast, outside pool, car service, it's all top notch and can''t be faulted. You get what you pay for expect to pay higher than average for food and drink, didn't bother me though.",5
"This hotel is truly amazing! The service which they have is personal and all the personnel  are kind and ready to answer your requests.  The hotel car picked us from the airport, even though our flight got delayed with 20 hours.When we came to the hotel, we were amazed by the rooms with the pool view - they are spacious and the view is magnificent!  The hotel amenities are more than enough - the gym has all the weights needed for a good training, the swimming pool is opened from 6am to 8pm. The restaurants are  at a world level.",5
The architecture is the first thing that hits you. The place is marvelously designed and very elegant with much greenery. The hotel has some nice restaurants to boast and I highly recommend this place.,5
"Perfect business or leisure hotel. Very close to cyber city, covering an unbelievable huge space in Gurgaon, with sheer oppulence and the legendary service of the Trident group. Will highly recommend over the typical hotels such as Taj or ITC.",5
"Everyone here is so friendly we feel as though we are returning, well thought of guests....but we just arrived today  After a drink in the bar where everyone made us so welcome and they were happy to chat as well....we ate in the fusion restaurant. Terrific. Beautiful presentation and choice at the buffet....more fantastic servers...the best Earl Grey tea ever....and we haven't tried the a la carte menu.....tomorrow is another day. The  bedrooms are spacious and perfect. Just like the rest of the hotel How do they make ceilings that high? ?? Watch this space for more hotels as we travel in India.... Bravo Trident....we' re coming to 4 more of your hotels in the next 3 weeks....see you there!",5
Breathtaking water play with fire. Nice pool area. Breakfast buffet huge. Food by the pool very delicious. Something complicated with communication. But this is typical india. :)  We booked some Trident hotels and our conclusion is Trident is a great Indian hotel company.,5
So once again the Trident shows what is all about. A buffet dinner for 50 people. The food was simply exceptional along with the usual perfect service. Their ability to provide a huge range of first class Indian dishes is amazing. If you can do a corporate dinner in summer even better - they have a roti oven and of course the daal is magnificent. Great job !!!,5
Our group of Glam Girls travel stayed here for two nights in November. We were bumped across from our booking at the Oberoi Maidens owing to an over booking situation BUT we loved the Trident The setting was fabulous. The actual rooms spacious and superbly fitted out. The bar and dining areas great. There was a wedding on whilst we were there so gorgeous well dressed guest everywhere. Immaculately looked after infinity pools and lantern lit walkways. Loved it .,5
"This is one of the best property I have stayed so far. The ambiance is good good, courteous staff, excellent environment and surroundings. Swimming pool is large and awesome and it will be an experience. Please do plan with your swimsuits especially during evening. Services are excellent and there is no opportunity for complaints usually. I would suggest international travelers to travel with international travel plug as electrical sockets may be an issue, otherwise everything awesome. The hotel is not far from Airport as well which is an added advantage.",5
"Saffron -- the fine dining indian resturant  The luxurious setting and awesome service gives immense satisfaction in this hotel . What comes next is the delicious food.  We went their after reading lots of reviews about its lunch thali , and were completely satisfied with it.  Its a four course meal , starting with the soup ( we had mulligatawny ) mind blowing , the attendent Mr Manish served with some pickles n papad ( v delicious), then came the appetizers n main course with choice of breads , he asked our preferences in the menu and let us change according to our choice , khurmi naan he served was v different and nice , all curries n dal were perfect so were the appetisers( we had paneer tikka , dahi kebab n hara bhara kebab), in the nain course were lucknowi paneer korma ,",5
"This hotel, in the middle of Gurgaon, is like an oasis of courtesy and pleasure. The staff are extremely attentive. They anticipate issues try to make the experience truly great and are quick to act on feedback. ",5
"This was the last hotel i stayed in on my ten day Golden Triangle plus Ranthambore and i think Titan saved the best to last , what a hotel 6* i think. i dont think this hotel can be any better lovely rooms  great location architecture unbelievable  great staff and the food wow",5
"This is a stunning property.  The landscaping is meticulous, and the architectural design is very different with a large reflecting pool in the front of the hotel and smaller reflecting pools in the rear by the swimming pool.  It is very sleek, very modern but reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh temple.  All stark white and light wood and black trim.  Almost strange, but very impressive.  I was a bit disappointed in the room itself since it was, like the rest of the hotel, very austere and very small.  The reflecting pools break the severity and are beautiful.  My stay there was comfortable. The locations of the nice hotels in Delhi do not have much around them and there are no walking areas outside of the hotel, just as here at the Trident.",4
The Trident Gurgaon is stunning from the get go. Even though the horizon was littered with cranes from a nearby building site the property is nothing short of amazing. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and the staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. It seemed like more of a business location but I can assure you there is plenty for a romantic couple to enjoy. The spa/massage treatment makes you feel like Royalty. All in all an excellent experience!,5
"No review is good enough for The Trident as a whole and their The Bar. I mean I was just caught off guard by their hospitality. As I said, no review is good enough, untill you experience it first hand",5
"i could say that the rooms are nice, that the Location is wonderful, that the pool is awesome - well sure but that's not it. The difference between a great Hotel and THE / THIS great Hotel is not the Equipment - it's the attitude of it's employees: every Moment the try to make Your stay more perfect - and that is what makes the difference.  This Hotel IS already my No 1 in the world - so it is difficult to beat it - but it constantly beats itself.. small Things like ""sir we saw Your Laptop Screen is dirty - we just brought you a cleaning kit"". Is this a MUST ? no. but it IS the difference between an excellent Hotel and THIS Hotel.. just perfect !",5
Stayed here for a business trip. It was an excellent stay. Service and food were very good. The room and the facilities were clean and the staff very friendly and attentive. The garden and pool were very scenic and also tranquil despite busyness in Mumbai. ,5
"This hotel is unique , great layout, amazing architecture and beautiful decoration.  The fact that you see water everywhere is very calming and pleasant. The rooms are great and the service is super! The Spa is excellent and staff super helpful.  The rest. Cilantro very nice and food delicious we had a server Nishant that took care of us like family, very nice young man, who knew everything about the dishes and provided us with great service.. we will always remember him with a big smile, Overall I would recommend this hotel in a second... is like and Oasys in the middle of the crazy are.",5
"the beauty of this property amazed me! i was crazy in love with the pool and the pathway to the pool! it`s so peaceful and calm there! room was clean and neat, and comfortable. the only minus point was the view from our room. it was looking right at the pathway where staff were going here and there and they could easily see our room. service is nice! i would love to go there again and again! love u Trident!",5
"In the craziness of Gurugram, this is such a peaceful place. The entrance is stunning and the landscaping and water bodies is just spectacular. It looks amazing in the night with all the lights. The rooms are nice and spacious.",4
This hotel never fails in its warm and hospitable welcome. Nothing is too much trouble and the team is always on hand to assist in whatever is required. Quick checkin in my room was appreciated given I arrived late. Lunch in the restaurant as delicious as ever. Room well presented with lots of small treats. Check out very efficient.,5
"We had an amazing night at this hotel  on the last night of our trip to India. Sadly we were only there for one night so we didn't get a chance to sample everything the hotel had to offer. The service was exceptional and best of all, the upgraded us to a stunning suite. Highly recommended.",5
In the rush of Gurgaon no one can imaging a beautiful and silent property like trident.  It is luxurious by all standards.   Unique all ground floor spread across several acres with landscaping and water bodies   The rooms are well equipped and very spacious   The hotel has special kids zone and attendants   The food is very good and tasteful and offers good variety   ,5
This is a great hotel in a convenient location. The hotel is very clean and well kept to a high standard. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I felt safe and would recommend to anyone needing to stay in this area. ,5
"Excellent hotel.. Great customer service especially by Ashish from Bell Desk who took extra care, took great pics of us, showed us around & helped with r queries..A special mention to Vishesh as well who organized our wedding event in Trident..",5
"A beautiful hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff (though efficiency did not always entirely match willingness). An excellent restaurant with great buffets for breakfast and dinner. The location is a bit desolate though, despite Gurgaon's dynamism as a modern industrial hub outside Delhi. Stay here only if you are with a tour group and have transportation.",4
"Beautiful hotel that is as enjoyed as on previous stays. Decent rooms with five star standards. Hotel staff always helpful but if you need to check out in a hurry, it's best to give good warning. Only three running machines in smallish gym. ",5
"The time you enter this hotel, it takes you to a whole new experience. So green, so serene, the ceilings are so high that gives you a feeling of a palace. Truly the best 5 star in gurgaon. The place is so calm that you can spend hours sitting and seeing the greenery all over.",5
"Stayed here on business last week and everything was very, very good.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  The food was very good and bar accommodating.   The rooms are a good size, not as big as the Oberoi next door, but still very comfortable.  The only thing that I think could be improved is the shower, it was a bit old and basic and seemed to stand out in a room that had everything else so well kept.     Would happily stay here again though when next in Gurgaon.",5
"There is no doubt that this hotel is stunning - a designer's dream.  Simple, modern architecture with pools and clever lighting. The interiors are lovely too - clean, simple, modern, elegant.  Nice big bedrooms with all the mod cons. As with all the hotels in this chain (I've stayed in a few), the service is excellent and the food delicious. But (and some will consider this nitpicking) I haven't given it 5 stars because it lacks atmosphere and could have been in any city anywhere. It felt artificial in the same way that many hotels in the Middle East do. I was lucky enough to discover a group of musicians playing in a side room, which was a treat - but virtually no one else was there listening because most guests would not have known they were there. A shame that this lovely",4
This is our second time here. The service is perfect . The staff are so friendly but not invasive at all. We love the swimming pool which is never busy as it is not as family orientated as some other places. We had room service breakfast as we left early for the airport. It was delicious and beautifully presented. ,5
Had the opportunity to visit Trident Gurgaon for a business event.  This is an imposing good looking property which looks ideal for business conferences as well as personal holidays. The conference was well organised in the spacious centre. Food served by the hotel was amazing and impressed all the guests around.  Plan to stay again at the property whenever we visit Gurgaon next,4
Located in a suburb of New Delhi this hotel is a peaceful retreat from the bustle of the big city. The grounds are lovely; at night there's the flicker of lamps light the paths. There's a nice-sized swimming pool and a modern gym. Rooms are very comfortable.,5
"I feel that its always good to appreciate the best experinces you have ever had . Trident hotels never lets you down and always exceeds your expectations. It was a weekend break at Trident Gurgaon and had a wonderful time with my family there. Right from you step out of your car you always get a smiling face greeting you & ensures that every need is taken care of the guests during stay. Got a room upgrade :) & would say staff was really helpful always on toes to make your stay memorable. You guys really rock , will always recommend everyone the property. Cheers !!!",5
"We arrived quite late to this hotel and had to leave early the following morning, which was a great shame as it was very beautiful.  The room was very comfortable with a lovely bathroom.  The restaurant was very good and the staff attentive and polite.  I can't really say a lot more as we did not experience much more.",4
"Stayed in one of the suits. The rooms were sizeable and well appointed. We were there as a stopover point for our Agra and then to Udaipur. The staff totally went out of the way to look after us on our anniversary stay. They had roses and cake waiting for us in the room, and sent a complimentary champagne also. We felt extremely well looked after. We went to the spa and had a couples massage. Both my husband & I felt it was one of the best massages we'd ever had! We have had A LOT of massages in our time so that is a big call. The restaurant Saffron had the most awesome collection of pickles ever. I tried many and many were good but the spicy mango one was my favorite. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay even though the style of the hotel is not one we normally go to on",5
"Amazing hotel in GURGAON excellent if your business are based in this area. Spacious hotel and what an amazing restaurant, one of the best Indian food I ever got served in the last year. Very sofisticate fixed men√π with a lot of unbelievable taste! Don't miss it.",5
"The hotel and staff were amazing throughout my three night stay, there is literally nothing more that they can provide! The free shuttles to the nearby mall was a bonus, perfect hotel that I would  recommend without hesitation! ",5
"This was my first trip to Gurgaon and I cannot explain how amazing the trip was purely from the hospitality I received from the Trident and their staff.  I felt completely at home and can honestly say I will return to the Trident.  There are many but Rohit was right there the whole time, we still keep in touch!",5
"We spend 3 nights in this complete dream of an hotel, after spending the days in busy dehli. The design, based on a lot of reflecting pools bring very quickly the sensation of peace, rare in a busy capital, even more in dehli",5
"We went on a week day for lunch buffet and though I had read reviews, I wasn't sure if the spread would be great.   My opinion is all reviews have appreciated less to the gastronomic creation that is served.   The spread is not large but it beats any contemporary on the offering, but that is all about common,   Right from the salads to soup to starters to main course to desserts to coffee, each  AND not  barring any all food on buffet is exceptional and amazing. There is a different taste to all laid and it seems humanly impossible for one  Chef to  create so diverse and yet perfect tastes.   I would be tempted to challenge if one can resist to try all of the spread and not go for round two.   Executive Sous Chef Mohan Soni is a smiling and content man, standing just a step away",5
"A business hotel, we were visiting for a conference.  Apart from location which was not so interesting for walk out... it was mostly superb. Pool, gym, breakfast lounge, customer service from front desk and house keeping was the speediest and most obliging I have experienced in a long time. Their indian restaurant Saffron was overpriced.",5
Surroundings superb & my room was to die for.  The food was excellent & staff were very helpful & efficient. Could not fault anything.  The pool was beautiful & the spa stunning.  I enjoyed a very peaceful time here.,5
"This hotel and it's staff is amazing. The service is fantastic and the staff so polite, warm and friendly. Everyone I came across were so happy to help in anyway they could. The food is delicious especially the Thali at dinner. My only fault is that free wifi is for 30 minutes per day only so if you need internet for business purposes you will have to pay. It was a welcome relief staying here as it's out of the hustle and bustle of Delhi and a short ride to the airport.",5
"Had a buffet breakfast and it was really good, though the cakes was dry and not soft / moist. From service to choices everything great. Huge options like made from scratch eggs benedict eggs florentine. Amazing dosas and out of the world bacon. Large variety of beverages and all in all satisfying start to the day",3
"Beautiful modern hotel on the outskirts of Delhi - ideal if you are flying out the from there, saves negotiating the horrendous Delhi traffic trying to get to the airport!  The hotel and its grounds are stunning and the staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.   This is a really good hotel befitting the flagship of the Trident chain.",5
"First time in India. I cannot compare to other places. Just checked in for one night. They took care of transportation from airport to hotel. Top service. Room service : great food! Everybody is really social and hospitality is great, top! Recommend for sure!!",5
Unfortunately I had only one night stay in this superb hotel but what a wonderful night! I indulged in a 90 minute Trident massage which was heavenly and would highly recommend this treatment while staying here. The moment of arrival with warm smiles from the start and an escort to The my room to run through the details was seamless and highly professional.  The suite was of exceptional standard along with the room service but the wifi here at the Trident has allowed me to complete my day's work in record time since arriving in India! If staying in New Dehli and looking for an exceptional hotel not far from the airport this is definitely the hotel to stay at. Thank you Jenny,5
"I stayed at this hotel.for only one night and wished it could have been longer.  My room was exquisitely decorated and the bed and bedding were crisp and comfortable.   The grounds are amazing from the waterfall entrance, to the marble lobby, to the pool area - just beautiful!    The staff was welcoming and hospitable.   I cannot wait to return to stay here for a longer period and to get to enjoy all this lovely hotel has to offer.",5
"The place is right in the middle of Business District of Gurgaon (or Gurugram as you might like it.) and is one of the most beautiful hotels that i would have stayed with the ambience, peace, and tranquility. i was on a quick one day stay here in early September with my wife and kid and they would certainly call it as stay which would have been called ""pampered"".... with the smily faces and proactive approach you always felt at home.  All the needs of my 1 Year old son was taken care off even without being asked for.  Always perfer to stay a Trident's.",5

"In spite of having been to the hotel long time back, it took more than 40 minutes inside Gurgaon to find the place. This is due to insufficient direction boards and lack of interaction with the locals who do not know where such a grand property is located. Even within the hotel the signage/directions need improvement. There should be no need to ask..  The buffet at the coffee shop was fine but not for the value of money. However, service was excellent.",4

"Recently stayed here for one night with my family including my daughters and we had a great time. The hotel is an Oasis with a unique design. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff and the service we experienced. Be it reception, room service, restaurant or pool area - the staff were simply outstanding and always willing to help you out with a smile. We also had a upgrade upon our arrival which was an added bonus.  The package we took also had complimentary shuttle services to Ambience mall and this was provided using high end cars like BMW & AUDI!! The pool is excellent, but not necessarily suitable for kids as it didn't have a shallow end and they also don't have a kids pool - but this however didn't stop my daughters from jumping and spending the best part of the",5
"I experienced the feel of India by its Asian influenced architecture. Wasn't looking for a Western chain hotel.  Service was solicitous.  Breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Sparkling, well maintained pool. Nice shops in the hotel. Comfortable room and bed. Good security upon entrance.",4
"The hotel is superb.  It's not cheap, but good value given the quality of the hotel.  The grounds and all the public areas are beautiful and very well maintained.  The staff to guest ratio is very high, and the staff are all very well trained.  The rooms are a very good size, and very clean and well equiped.  There is a very nice pool and a good gym.  The hotel is very quiet as it set in very large grounds.  The whole hotel is low rise (only 2 storey) and spread out which can mean some longish walks.  The restaurants are excellent and you can also eat in the Oberoi next door which is part of the same group (you can charge to your room in the Trident).  The Oberoi restaurants are also excellent.  Wifi is charged, but quite fast and reliable.  The hotel is convenient for the",5
"Stayed three and a half weeks in the Trident. The hotel facilities are first class, and the staff are very nice. The hotel is peaceful and is very good to recharge your batteries, bur step outside and it's busy Gurgaon. The staff are very helpful and kind, special mention to Saurav who gave me a few tips to visit Gurgaon/Delhi, made me taste the kima pharata and bought a nice indian shirt for me. Attention to detail is on display, I was given a shoe bag, and a mouse pad was placed on my desk as I didn't have one.  The food is good from the complimentary breakfast to the big choice on offer at Cilantro. The indian food at Saffron is also very good abeit a little pricey.",5
"We hosted the launch of Jason Byrne Edinburgh's highest selling stand up comedian for AGP World. The experience resonated from the bar to the ballroom and finally concluded in sumptuous dinner party. The rooms are palatial, traditional Indian hospitality and great care is taken to customise food for every palate. An island away from home.",5
"I recently visited this hotel for a business meet, its really amazing, had a warm welcome, the entrance area was soo grand, I parked my car without any hassle, the lounges are really big, I relaxed there for some time before starting a meet,the projection room is quite big well temperature maintained, I successfully presented my presentation, the arrangements are perfection to the core... Overall had a wonderful business meet..",5
Home from Home  Another fantastic stay at this superb hotel. Have been to the Caribbean since and wish Nitesh  Gandhi and his team could run the hotel there! Trident Gurgaon is the only hotel I would stay in in Delhi. Convenient for airport and city. Service second to none. Highly recommended. ,5
"Just arrived into Delhi late last night.  But certainly woke up with the welcome from Trident Gurgaon staff, right from the airport thro to checking in experience.  Such personal and welcome service is not common and must be appreciated - that's why I wanted to write this review even though it has only been 10 hours since arrival, with 5 of those hours sleeping comfortably in my room.",5
Loved every bit of it.. Especially the konomi section. The hotel itself is a good place to recreate oneself. Please visit the place.. You won't regret.. This I can assure you... Worth the expenditure too! ,5
"I always can say thanks for all Trident Gurgaon team. They always make me feel like a home and treat me like a Queen. Was my birthday and they gifted me with a nice cake and flowers, what surprise ! Is my 5th stay at Trident Gurgaon and next year hope be there again...  Love you guys !",5
"Incredible Experience, Service and hospitality in all departments from Reception to dining to house keeping to Gym to Pool to Bar!!!  I am from UK and had very high expectations on quality and delivery of service. Given the length of stay (6 weeks) in a hotel, I had mixed feelings before the stay.  Pleasant surprise!!! Trident met over and above my expectations!!! (especially the whole team in Cilantro restaurant) Trident's focus and care on guests' comfortable stay are truly commendable.  Dining: Both in room dining and specialized restaurants in Trident are outstanding. They cook food like a piece of art and it is customized for every guest in an unique way as per their preferences! we want to express our appreciation for the superior service we received at the restaurant.They",5
"This was my second stay at the Trident and I still consider it my favorite in Gurgaon.  I was a little disappointed that they put me in a room with 2 twin beds upon arrival.  I thought that since I gave them such a good review last time they would have made sure I got a king bed room.  But it was just a minor inconvenience as they were able to move me to a king bed room the next day.  While the rooms are nicer at the Oberoi next door, what I love most about the Trident is the staff and hotel grounds.  Everyone here makes you feel welcome.  I want to recognize Mohit, who is a doorman into the courtyard.  He always seems so happy to see me when I am there and is a nice way to start the day. I was also very impressed with the laundry and housekeeping service.  I had a tear in my",5

Had booked 27 rooms along with lunch dinner on the check in day and breakfast and lunch for the next day . Due to a guests death there was a delay in getting the rooms but the hotel was courteous enough to offer complimentary beverages in the bar for all !!!! . Lunch was booked in their Saffron restaurant [ Traditional Indian cuisine with traditional Indian music which was extraordinary]. It was one of the best Indian lunches I have had.

The hotel has high soaring ceilings and expansive space making it very relaxing. It is connected to the Oberois next door where my colleagues and I had a wonderful dinner at 361. The Trident breakfast is very good. The only wish I have is that the pillows weren't so flat but otherwise, Trident has one of the best hotel staff Ive ever had the pleasure of being around. ",5

For me, it's the Hospitality which is unmatched to anywhere I have stayed.  If I say, epitome in Hospitality, it will not be an overstatement.  The entire staff is there with one single mission - ""make you feel best""  Special mentions:  1. Palak at the time of check-in 2. Prachi at the time of check-out  Lastly, I am spoiled to stay anywhere else!!  ",5
What a magnificent hotel. The entrance is spectacular and the rest of the property lives up to it. The rooms were extremely well appointed and very comfortable. The restaurants within the hotel were world class. The service given by all the staff was great. We enjoyed all aspects of the hotel during our two day stay and would highly recommend it.,5
"Trident Gurgaon - Oberoi chains prized property in Gurgaon has much to boast about. It's amazing location, it's well manicured gardens and the look of the hotel that will make you fall in love at the first sight. The hotel still remains it's Visual charm with its pristine water bodies. Unbelievable that it is located so close to such congested street in Gurgaon.   For this hotel, hospitality and service with a smile remains their truest differentiator. They say yes to everything you ask. Simple. They don't have a NO for an answer. Their staff is amongst the very best that I have encountered and they are super accommodating with every request that one would have. They go out of their way to make kids happy and guests comfortable. The fact that property was badly sold out given",4

"Make no mistake - this hotel is on par as the very highest quality in India and puts to shame many major brands in europe. Hotel is located about 25mins from Delhi airport and very close to Cyber city, most people visit here for busiess from the west. The hotel is in a peaceful location away from the hussle n bussle. Security is great so great its thorough. Reception arranged ride in the Mini cooper for me 1 of the days which was cool. The staff are incredible here - everysingle one made my stay special and bought a smile to my face. The welcoming you are given at all times js world class. Some of the guys who were superb included - Chef Deep, Ramman (food manager), Prechi reception manager and Vidushi on front desk. The food is stunning and breakfast quality is out of this",5

From the minute you arrive and are greeted by the wonderful bell staff at the entrance, you are welcomed to the finest hotel experience you will ever receive.  With staff stationed at every entrance, anything you could possibly need or want for is met almost before you ask.  I have never seen a staff so capable of reading their guest's needs and accommodating them with the level of pride, quality, and dedication as the staff at the Trident.  The room is top notch from the amenities provided to the daily housekeeping services.  Every restaurant is absolutely excellent in food quality and service provided.  A special recognition goes to the daily breakfast staff who welcomed me with a smile every morning, made sure I",5
"This is my second time to Gurgaon region of New Delhi for business.  Previously I stayed in Oberoi Gurgeon, the sister property and owner of Trident.  My company for some reason changed their loyalty to this Trident property.  While both are very nice properties with exceptional service, I think the Oberoi is slightly better in that the rooms are much larger.  As I was staying there 4 nights, I would have preferred the larger room.  The Trident, however, has much more interesting architecture and I think the pool is a bit better although I did not swim in it.  The Trident was VERY clean , but there were a few signs of ""aging"" in my room (bathroom paint chips in places and furniture scuffs).  Not a big deal to me.  Food was very good at Trident and they did a GREAT job at",4
"I am yet to check out but couldn't resist posting this review. After being a Taj loyalist since childhood, and patronizing it for more than 25 years, I was surprisingly shocked to see the the OBEROI/Trident group offer such superlative hospitality. I travel a lot. If not the Taj, I usually stay at a JW or a Hyatt/Meridien or similar. Always avoided the OBEROI coz I thought no indian chain would beat the service of a Taj. But I was so wrong. Such amazing staff, across every level. Special mention to Pankaj who manages the restaurants. Superb food at Saffron and the coffee shop. Great ambience and architecture. M coming back for sure!",4
"Even though it now shares a common wall with Oberoi but Trident still is the best property in Gurgaon. The huge water body with fire burning in the middle at night hits you as soon as you step inside. Always found it to calming  Two excellent restaurants Cilantro and saffron who serve delicious food , rooms are big and luxurious with the ones on pool side really special.  Swimming pool looks so nice and gym is much more than just functional. Staff is fantastic. One highlight for trident is the great new year night , the buffet is possibly the best that night and they offer a great over night stay package on new year eve night. It's a must try",5
"We had 3 nights stay for a short business and leisure trip combined. We liked the place instantly. First the staff was very attentive and a lady at the reception took the time to talk to us about things we could do in the city and was helpful to give options to my wife who stayed at the hotel while I was at work. The staff was extremely well trained in hospitality, not only respectful and helpful but also very friendly. The facility was beautiful with a main fountain in the center where all the center rooms had a view. It gave the impression that the rooms were in the water.  Lots of greenery and flowers. We had dinner twice and despite being expensive restaurants, the quality was top notch. The Indian restaurant was wonderful for our foreign palates. Again service was",5
"I have always been partial to an Oberoi property, in respect to their hospitality. True their standard the Trident Gurgaon does not disappoint. The property takes you to a relaxed resort ambience, due to its architecture and setting. An oasis in the metropolitan of Delhi. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast was amazing. Would definitely recommend this property to anyone considering a trip to Delhi. ",5
"The Trident hotel is simply the very best hotel that goes well beyond expectations. From the very moment you enter the gates to the moment you leave and everything in between is just perfect. The rooms are spacious and immaculately  clean. The food is just exceptional with plenty of choice. The common areas are vast and clean and include a spa, pool and gym. Finally the service is simply the best I've ever received whilst travelling the world.   Well done Trident! Simply the best. ",5
"I stayed in this property for two weeks and really enjoyed warm reception by staff. All the staff right from the reception to housekeeping to restaurants were amazing. I enjoyed very prompt services all the time. I enjoyed dinner having delectable food in Saffron all the time and breakfast too in the breakfast lounge.   I would like to thank all the staff in the property for taking care of my needs very well. I remember few names to recognize their special efforts to make my stay memorable. Those names are Chef Mohan Soni, Sanjay (in Saffron), house keeping supervisor, Abhishek and his team, Aakanksha at reception. I would love to visit the place again.",5
"I have stayed at many hotels in India for business and Trident hotel in Gurgaon was the best hotel I have ever stayed at in India.  The Service was outstanding, From the moment I was greeted by the driver who collected me at the airport I knew it be a great stay.  My room was cleaned by a gentleman called Karman, he took pride in his work and ensured my room was always clean, he even gave me a shoe bag for my shoes.  The food was outstanding and the Executive Sous Chef Mohan Soni could cater for any requirement.

"I stayed here recently n a business trip. The room was very comfortable. Half an hour from airport and another half hour (subject to traffic) to Delhi city. Facilities good, plenty of restaurant choice. Staff very courteous. My only issues were that I had to pay for internet, and the hotel green policy was not great i.e. sheets changed daily and towels were taken away and washed regardless, this could be improved. Hotel services such as cars were also expensive, I advise Uber.",4
"I have just completed a 2 night stay at The Trident Hotel in Gurgaon, India. The property itself is very unique and it is quite large which gives a very resort like feel to the place which is great considering it is very central. There are many manicured gardens and water features within the property which is also very pleasant, fresh and soothing. The property is fantastically upheld and it feels brand new. The rooms are very comfy and I enjoyed on both nights a very comfortable nights sleep. The showers are one of the best I have used in Asia, powerful flow of water and temperature to suit your preference. The breakfast spread is very nice and there is plenty to keep your taste buds satisfied. I particularly enjoyed the freshly prepared omelettes and the masala dosas. All the",4
"What a find the Trident is. Part of the Oberoi group this hotel feels very much like its sister hotels with exceptional service. It's a great hotel to chill in for a few days or like me weeks and has some stunning futures. You are greeted before entering the hotel my magnificent water features which go a great job at cooling the air before going into the hotel building, which is air conditioned (as you'd expect), contemporary and welcoming. There's a formal and informal bar area as well as internal and external dinning facilities. ",5
I have stayed at the trident previously and am generally very impressed however the quality of food this stay for what they charge was below average. The dinner buffet lacked taste for the Indian food items I tried. It seemed stale ... Not impressed this time ... Sorry trident ...,3
"Words will not do justice to the hospitality exhibited at this hotel. I stayed there for about 5 weeks, checking in and out 3 separate times during my stay. I can honestly say that each time I checked out and then back in, it felt like I was ""coming home"", which I think speaks volumes as to how I was treated during my stay. Another big thank you to everybody at the Trident Gurgaon!",5
"I stayed here recently on my first trip to Gurgaon, where our office is situated in the nearby Cyber City. I will really just repeat what other recent reviewers have said: the Trident is an oasis of calm in busy, chaotic Gurgaon.  When you're inside the hotel grounds it's almost impossible to imagine the chaos on the roads around, although you know it's there. The whole design of the hotel exudes calm, with a lovely old-style feel. The staff also play a big part in creating this atmosphere and are superb.  I only ate breakfasts in the hotel, at Cilantro, but the selection, quality and - once again - the service were all great.  Although I didn't have time to use them, I checked out the pool, spa and gym which all looked great. Normally when travelling I try to stay at one of a",5

Stayed for 3 days on 2 separate occasions.  Service and accommodations exceptional. Meals were also outstanding. The hotel staff are extremely attentive.  Free wifi was very limited ( 12 hours only). I had to purchase a package.  I would have given this resort 5 stars if they had better wifi.  Rooms very comfortable with good amenities. ,4
"Best hotel in NCR,great indian food even in the coffee shop,extremely polite and hospitable staff,lots of complementary starters and desserts served,enjoy every time i go there,special thanks to Mr.Mohan Soni(chef) and Mr.Tanuj.A must visit if you are looking for late night fine Indian cuisine which is available in the coffee shop or speciality Indian food in saffron.Must try Hara kebabs,and veg biryani.Dal makhani tastes excellent and goes best with malabar paratha.The Trident is a beautiful hotel and makes you feel you are visiting a palace.I personally find it better than most five stars in delhi-NCR area.",5
"I stayed at the Trident for a week on business. The hotel is beautiful, set in gardens with ponds and fountains. Its a refreshing change from the boring high rise hotels you normally find.  The hotel's best feature is the staff and the service. They are very friendly and helpful and as a guest you feel very welcome. It was my first time in India and I felt that whatever I needed there was always somebody there to help.  The restaurant is also good with a choice of European, Asian and Indian food.",5
"I absolutely love this hotel, it's by far the best in Gurgaon. The property is beautiful, it feels very spacious, the rooms are cozy and warm in design, the pool and gym are nice. The staff is incredibly attentive and fulfills your every wish. Small problems will be solved immediately and you never have to wait for a friendly word from someone from the team. They all go out of their way to make it a comfortable stay, the drivers, the receptionists, the F&B team, absolutely everyone. I had one minor issue that I told them about and they went out of their way to accommodate me and make me feel looked after. I can only recommend this place.",5
"Has to be one of the best hotels I've ever stayed it on a business trip, the food is out of this world and I even had time for a massage which was one of the best I've ever experienced! The rooms are on one level so no one above you and alway with a soft soothing sound of a water feature...will be returning for a leisure trip next I'm sure!",5
"This is an amazing hotel.   By far and away it has the highest level of service I have experienced in any hotel globally (including Europe, Asia, Russia).  The staff are eager to please, and they all know you by name.  I was travelling on business, however I would also bring my family to stay here.  The restaurants are of a high quality, the gym and pool is also excellent.  I will definitely stay here again.",5
"This hotel is exceptional, it's architecture with the largest entrance doors I've every seen. The reception area is well appointed with plenty of well trained and helpful staff. The rooms are of the highest standard, well appointed bathroom with all the amenities you expect from a five star hotel. The bar area with its array of cocktails is wonderful and the restaurant serves fantastic dinners and breakfast. What a swimming pool with complementary bottles of water and ice cold face cloths - staff add that something extra. As we stayed at this hotel on the last night before our flight to the UK it left us with wonderful memories of the quality and service from Trident hotels in which we stayed.",5
"Great hotel with everything that you need onsite.. from a huge pool (you're going to need it if you're traveling here in the summer), nice fitness center (free weights available), spa, and nice places to eat (can be pricey).  Only downside is that it's away from outside shopping and places to eat.  They offer complementary rides to and from Ambiance Mall, which I understand is the largest mall in Delhi.",5
"There are two types of luxury hotels, one with gorgeous greenery and lavish open space spread over sprawling acres of land and the others with pride of verticality. The Trident hotel at Gurgaon belongs to the former type.  You feel special the moment you step out of your car. You will be greeted by the hotel personnel with a broad smile on face and the seamless process of checking in will start then and there only.  You are awestruck with the ambiance and feel like clicking images even before checking in and in spite of the fact that you are a seasoned traveler and not exactly an excited teenager!  No time was lost standing at the counter and promptly I was escorted to the room. The walk was also memorable by the side of flowing water bodies.  The room was perfect and very",5
As always amazing experience ....it was our last night in India & they upgraded us to a suite ! I love this hotel for its service & ambience . The staff are truly welcoming & the attention to detail fab .the pool is a welcome oasis in then bustle of Gurgaon  ,5
"I stayed here for three nights last week. My second stay. Lovely rooms, great pool, which looks stunning at night. good spacious gym and nice restaurant  Staff v friendly as well. Only slight itratation is a lack of irons. But overall a really nice hotel, an oasis of calm in what can be a crazy place. The local mall is also huge and worth a visit ( the ambiance mall)  ",5
Excellent Business and a classic hotel.well maintained.had a wonderful business meet there..rooms are really awesome.nice swimming pools..great cuisine..no words to describe the beauty of the hotel and the premises..staff's are really courteous..overall experience was wonderful...,5
For someone who is very familiar with Delhi / Gurgaon I was not expecting this property to be very different from all the others in the vicinity. However the moment you enter you feel you are in a different city all together. Beautifully built hotel with lush green exteriors is a treat to watch. We got upgraded to a room which was pool facing and it was one of the finest rooms ( View wise). The way they have built up the area surrounding the pool is unlike any other hotel I have seen. Lovely views from the room. The service was very good and we enjoyed our dinner in their Indian restaurant. All in all a wonderful stay.,5
"My wife and I had the good fortune to stay st The Trident Gurgaon hotel for two nights recently before catching our flight home at nearby Indira Ghandi Airport, Delhi.   The hotel is absolutely beautifully appointed with really high ceilings, huge tall doors throughout the hotel and wonderful restaurants and bar.   The design and architecture in the communal areas are breathtaking and the central conical feature in the bar is really special & eye catching.  The food and ambiance in both restaurants is excellent as is the service.  Service levels throughout the hotel are as one would expect from the Oberoi Group, but if you haven't experienced the Oberoi Group service and guest care you are going to be in for such a nice surprise.....in a word, Outstanding!!      The pool, gym",5
"Beautiful setting and decor - like walking into an arty magazine shoot.  Wonderful service from all the staff, every single one.  Great food,  great accommodation,  lovely swimming pool and spa.  Loved it,  loved it,  loved it.",5
"I have visited his hotel multiple times for business.  The hotel is great in all aspects.  It has a beautiful campus with lush green grass, fountains, nice looking swimming pool.  The rooms are large (also, all rooms are on ground floor) and the service is impeccable.  The breakfast buffet is elaborate. The food at all the restaurants is also quite worth it.  A great stay if you have business/work near Gurgaon.",5
My experience its best every thing good food mostly very delicious...all staff support to us..and place to awsome.my family say to me next tym coming in gurgaon book this hotel only...excellent the hotel and great trip,5
Enjoying the well spend day with the anurag in the pool side he is very Hamble  and so attentive for each and every guest.. He is like 1 man army in pool side... And enjoying  rain in summers too.. even the gym pool and all the decor  of the hotel is amazing  feeling so relaxed once u come inside this hotel,5
Excellent business hotel in gurgaon. Close to airport and business district. High quality spacious and clean rooms Tranquil surrounds with beautiful water features and ponds. 20mins to international airport. Try to get a room overlooking the ponds. Only issue is the small steps leading to the reception a minor annoyance if you have bags on wheels. Look to use the pathways instead,4
"If luxury and hospitality could be personified, it would imply you have experienced the Trident at Gurgaon. Right from the airport transfer to the checkout, our stay at the Trident was only  full of pleasant experiences. The day prior to our check in, I spoke to the front office representative Ms. Aakansha and I must say she really went the extra mile to make our first ever experience at the Trident a memorable one. The airport transfer in a sleek black Audi, the complimentary trips to the iconic Ambience Mall as well as the painstaking effort to research on the mode of transportation she made really touched our heart. Thank you Aakansha.  We would also like to thank the Front Office Manager Mr. Tauseef for his understanding. We were not informed that the airport transfer had a",5
We spent a night here after staying at the Oberoi next door and for leisure travellers it was a more welcoming experience. The red domes and arches of the common areas are very attractive and the pool area is surrounded by trees and comfortable seating. Rooms are functional and well equipped and breakfast was very good though we were less enthusiastic about the curry we had for dinner. Staff helpful friendly and plentiful. The hotel is quite a long drive from the main tourist sights of Delhi but as the odd/even driving rule was introduced when we were there the journey became much easier overnight! Would happily stay again as the Trident was good value for money,4
"An oasis in an otherwise chaotic city ... Tranquility redefined. Amazing service and a beautiful hotel. The staff was very friendly and hospitable. Great spread at breakfast and in general, the food was nice and the service in the restaurants was very good. ",5
"The Trident is situated on one of the main highways out of New Delhi.  For such a noisy locale it is hard to believe the tranquility that The Trident is able to achieve.  The architecture is modern, but manages to avoid a cookie-cutter approach by paying respect to its Asian heritage, and the gardens and water features are absolutely beautiful.  The rooms and bathrooms are large and well-appointed, have very little outside noise, and are kept spotlessly clean.  Guests are able to use the facilities of the Trident and the adjoining Oberoi.  We were happy with both properties in respect to the common areas and food offerings.  There is nothing to do immediately outside the hotel, but it is convenient to the airport, offers tours, and is on the main road to Jaipur if you are",5
"The trident is a wonderful property with helpful and competent staff. The rooms are well appointed.  There is privacy and peaceful silence within the hotel premises.  The food was surprisingly better than the more illustrious neighbouring property, Oberoi Gurgaon, especially the Indian cuisine.  However, here is my experience that shocked me. I had some cash in my briefcase. At the hotel entry point, the security and hotel staff took charge of my baggage after being unloaded  from the taxi. I noticed that there was an x Ray machine at the entrance that gives visual dispaly of the contents of the bag. I was separated from my bags for about 10 min between then and the time the bags reached my room. Next morning I found part of the cash missing. The management saidnthey had done",4
"Picture this: you arrive after an arduous one hour ride from the airport, stuck in traffic, squeezed between cars blowing the horns. You enter the hotel gates, you get off and then BLISS! A black reflecting pool with a torch, you are greeted with characteristic warmth and politeness and then, best part you don't have to check-in at the front desk, you are shown straight to your room where check-in takes place. Beautiful room, great feel good, I didn't want to get out. The bar was very good and very reasonably priced and breakfast was not about huge buffet choice but attending to your needs. I need to try the pool next time. Verdict: great place in a crazy, polluted city, fantastic choice if you come for business.",5
"Probably my favourite hotel anywhere.  It is an absolute ""relax fest""  The service everywhere you go in the hotel is exceptional.   I think you can view an infinity pool from every room in the hotel.  The food is great and don't be surprised if the executive chef pops over for a chat to ensure you are happy with your meal.  It's not cheap but it is when you consider the level of service you get.  I love it üëç",5
"Stayed here for a night and its an absolute oasis in the neighbourhood of Gurgaon. The staff is extremely courteous and the rooms are very well appointed. However it surprises me that given the amazing rooms they choose to have a fully enclosed bath instead of natural light coming in.   The swimming pool is nice. It has a nice bar and a only three restaurants. The food is extremely good, though they could work on the desert menu. The al day dining restaurants could have been better in decor.   Its great to stay here for its small hotel feel and amazing entry and high ceilings and head to the oberoi for a brunch on a sunday. The internal walkway makes it an easy approach and the reception is more than welcome to reserve a table.   Overall al great stay and wonderful staff.",5
i went to the hotel on 19th april with my family...first thing i dint like was to walk so much firstly to reach reception and then to rooms....it makes u tired so much evrytime u just come back to room....otherwise service is good and feel of the hotel or resort is just too good....looks beautiful at night....second thing i dint like was at breakfast there was no mentioning of non veg or veg food....no red or green dots...and all are placed together...food taste was good....but setup was so poor being a five star chain. overall a average experience...,4
"We really loved this hotel!   The treatment is amazing, the food is awesome, it's perfect for some scape days from the Delhi Mess.  The staff people are the incredible nicest and professional people (especially the girl from reception and the Gym personal trainer, Saurav, you should ask for him when visiting the Gym).  We felt very welcome there.  Thank you so much!  We'll return for sure! ",5
"I've been here many times, it's a fantastic hotel. All common areas and facilities are excellent, so does breakfast . Unfortunately my room and bathroom started to show some aging signs, needed some renovation. Nevertheless I enjoyed my stay, the service was great as usual. Here it's about being pampered and spoiled...",5
"Not a very fancy hotel, but certainly an enjoyable stay. I have stayed here many times and always feel like ""coming home"". The team does a good job of extending warm welcome and extra care, especially Ganesh in the restaurant and Alok at the bar. The buffet for breakfast and dinner is also very good, lots of variety and delicious flavors. And don't miss the lobby shop where you will see a delightful collection of truly fine artwork from several styles. I will stay here again and again.",5
"Another great stay at Trident - hotel staff exceeds 5 star rating . The ambience of the hotel, the warmth of the staff, great breakfast, wonderful pool ... creates an out of the world magical experience. Highly highly highly recommended pls d to stay when you are visiting Delhi /Gurgaon region.",5
"We had a great stay at the Trident in Gurgaon.  It was very clean, nice and amazing staff.  They even packed us a breakfast to go since we had an early flight in the morning.  Highly recommend this hotel and being so close to the airport is a huge bonus.",5
"This review is long overdue and due to work pressures I am only writing it today for which I apologise.   I had travelled to Delhi on the 5th March for a 4 day trip for my late father‚Äôs last ceremony which can be performed after the 1st year anniversary has passed. I was staying at Trident Gurgaon with my 2 siblings. I would like you to know that I was thoroughly impressed with my stay at Trident Hotel Gurgaon. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff at Trident Gurgaon for all they have done for me. I can‚Äôt praise them enough and whatever I say about them is definitely not enough. The culture you have created in Trident Gurgaon and speaking from my own experience, is something that all organisations in the world need to learn and practice it in their own",5
"A nice, warm hotel with good sized rooms.  Pool and gym are great and the bar is warm and inviting.    Breakfast isn't great but you can always walk over to the Oberoi next door and get a much better breakfast.    There is a way to get to the Oberoi without going outside the gates and if you ask they will happily allow you to use the breakfast included at the Oberoi   One warning.  The hotel is far from Dehli so don't stay here if you want to see the tourist sites.",4
"I've spent two months in the Trident Gurgaon on business and the hotel is perfect. The staff always go the extra mile, I regularly use all the amenities such as the gym and pool. Saurav in the gym at the trident was very knowledgeable about fitness, polite and friendly and always happy to help. He stood out for me amongst a set of staff which are all excellent. I would stay here again without fail.",5
best property to stay in ....rooms are big clean and toilets are too clean and neat  restaurant has great food and noce buffet in breakfast ....they have pool to dip in as well ..room ssrvice 24 hrs !!,5
"I was in Gurgaon for a business trip and stayed at this hotel for 2 days. It was amazing, both interior and services. On my request they offered me a smoking room. We had a meeting and all arrangements are superb. Most important the professionalism of all hotel staff. Although I had an experience in staying in many 5 star hotel in India and abroad, but this time I really enjoy my stay",5
"... but overall way too much for me. I've had the feeling they ""overdo"" service. Restaurants are very good, rooms are great, pool wonderful. YOu can get a bit lost in the long hallways ... Loved 24/7 service, I arrived after midnight and could order anything I wanted from teh menue... When you enter, the view and the colors are stunning.",4
The hotel was so futuristic like something out of Star Wars on arrival.The staff were lovely could not have done enough.i did feel though it is more a business hotel rather than tourist well placed for the airport.rooms were fantastic small bar near the pool had free wifi there was a rather out of place disco type bar that was playing the most awful music when we there.nobody was in there but we could not bear to go in a for nightcap as so awful.which was a real shame and at breakfast we could not work out who would have bothered with that music looking at the clientele.We sat outside for dinner and breakfast and recommend that as do lovely,4
"We loved our stay at the Trident! We were on a business trip and as soon as we arrived after a long and hot day of work we were greeted by the most relaxing environment in the middle of manic Dehli!   The staff were attentive but not annoyingly so! Food was good and it's linked to the Oberoi too, so you can just take a walk through if you fancy having some food or drinks there!  I would highly recommend this hotel! ",5
"This is without doubt the perfect hotel for a business trip to Gurgaon.  Outside there is chaos, but as soon as you step through to the reflecting pool in front of the reception all is calm.  I found myself sighing happily that I was back every day.  The staff were friendly and attentive without being annoying or over-bearing.  The food was extraordinary in both Cilantro and Saffron.  I had both Indian and Japanese cuisine at the hotel and can safely say it's among the best of its kind that I've had.  The spa was extremely well equipped and what I needed desperately, the pool was larger than expected and the rooms were faultlessly clean and beautiful.  They bent over backwards to accommodate our request to transfer our booking to the Trident in Jaipur for one night and that",5
"This hotel is nice. The food is average. My main issue was Our rooms smelled of cigarette smoke and were slightly musty. It wasn't a strong smell but enough that my colleague and I both got sinus infections while there from the poor air quality in the rooms. We asked for non smoking rooms and the hotel kept telling us that we were in non smoking rooms, however, every morning we passed a sign that said ""smoking rooms"" right outside our hotel room door. The hotel did nothing to move us to the non smoking room section of the hotel, who knows if it even exists. India is a very polluted place so air purifiers are essential. I would recommend the Oberoi next door if you have to travel to India. It's a messed up country in general and dealing with the hotel staff is enough to make you",1
"super luxe hotel', ultra modern facilities, super comfy bed and delicious in  house dining option. a second to none oberoi hotels. Great staffs, forgot the name of the person who assisted me in businness centre: an undoubtedly was a great help. Sheer luxury, great hotel.",5
"Even though I got a chance to stay in this hotel for one night only but let me tell you that this property is great and the hospitality even better. Everything about the hotel is good. The location is peaceful, the hotel is beautiful, the staff are helpful and polite, the rooms are nice and clean and the quality of food is good. The pool side is nice and well made. The staff is thoughtful for example they gave cold water bottles to those sitting in the pool area as it was a hot day. The service is excellent. The only area I think they can improve in is quality and presentation of breakfast.",5
"I had a wonderful experience working out with the trainers at Trident Gurgaon Gym. I love to workout and I needed guidance to target a specific muscle and they were very helpful. The Gym was very clean and the services are next to none. Every one was so friendly and you should work out with Saurav Bhatti while you are there. very good trainer, and knowledgeable on the different muscle groups. and did i mention you can play your own music at the gym while you work out.?",5
"This was one of, if not, the best hotel we have stayed in. The staff very kindly presented me with flowers and cake as it was my birthday.  The room was luxurious - only wish we could have stayed longer.  Looking forward to returning for a longer stay.  This was a perfect ending to our holiday in India.",5
"The pan seared salmon by chef Sandeep restored my faith . The awful meal a few months back in 361 - Japanese master chef serving lukewarm , below average lamb after an hour long wait - made me feel god had abdicated his kingdom .He is somewhat long in the tooth but the magic, the obsession with excellence that will leave the Indian hotel industry once he is gone , endures. Indeed the engineers in Trident quickly fixed the dvd player while The Oberoi had struggled endlessly last time we  stayed there. The Trident was , once again,  exceptional.  The eggs benedict were very nice . The service would make any Four Seasons proud including Jimbaran Bay.Chef I am not sure Japanese eat cauliflower in Teppan Yaki. HE always  aimed to transcend the frozen French Fry  mediocrity  of cookie",5
"I have stayed here twice, 3 weeks each, and my stay here was one of the most memorable hotel experience ever.  The hotel staff is simply amazing, and I have no issues to note for the hotel grounds and rooms.  Everything was just great, the lobby, amazing room size and views, the amenities, and of course the really delicious variety from brunch and the elegant dinner at the Indian restaurant there.  Simply perfect!",5
The Trident Gurgaon is a peaceful place and it is well staffed and managed.  Very tranquil surroundings.  Room was fine with comfortable beds and powerful shower. Lovely large white towels.  Pool and spa were fine. Gym was excellent and well equipped. Ate at the Indian restaurant on site and it was fantastic and definitely one to recommend. Excellent staff too and musical entertainment.  Half an hour to New Delhi and half an hour to the airport so fairly well located.  Wanted joining rooms for the family and weren't able to secure them which was a unfortunate but not the end of the world.  Had to pay for the wifi too!,4
"This hotel is located 5 minutes away from one of the famous malls of Gurgao, Ambience mall. Moreover the hotel provides a complimentary pick up and drop to the mall ( in a Mini cooper :P ) . The food in their main restaurant is superb even though it is a bit exorbitantly priced. The staff is very polite and helps you with anything you want .",5
"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night at the end of an organised tour as it is close to the airport. When you make the short walk from the parking area to the lobby it really takes your breath away. There's a large area of water (a reflection pool!) that looks like it's floating. One of the staff told me that the hotel was built in 2004 but it looks brand new. We noticed several huge domes around the complex. There's a bar and business centre to the left as you enter and the rooms seemed to be in a square around a large pool and beauty spa/ treatment area. There's a small bar next to the pool where you can get free wifi.  Rooms are spacious with a sofa and large bed and arty photos of Delhi sites and an embriodered creation above the bed. There's satellite TV, a mini bar and",5
"I loved this hotel. The service is impeccable. Completely exceptional. The grounds are amazing with the water and architecture perfectly thought out.   My family and I stayed here two separate times on our trip to northern India (on the front end and back end).   Our first time, our bags were lost in transit and we had to wait over 24 hours to get our bags. My one complaint is that the hotel could have been a bit more prompt in getting us our bags when they did arrive (as we were in the same clothes that we had on as we traveled half way around the world). Nevertheless, the rooms were fabulous and we had a great view of the pools.   The food was top notch. It was great to know that all of the water coming to the hotel was filtered, which gave us Americans some ease knowing that",5
"Amazing property, great hospitality, delicious food! The hotel is structured like a palace with a very well designed architecture. The staff is very hospitable. The rooms are designed around an artificial water body which makes it look like you are in a different world altogether. Very quite and relaxing a place if you are traveling to Gurgaon.",5
"I travel regularly all over the world. The service and facilities in the Trident are superb,  the staff cannot do any more to make your stay memorable. I actually look forward to coming here - unlike many other hotels I stay in around the world  Strongly recommended as an oasis within the Delhi chaos! ",5
"I recently stayed at the Trident for business on two separate occasions.  It's a relatively small hotel in comparison to some of its neighbours, and it's nice to have somewhere to stay that's not greater than a couple of floors.  From arrival to departure the friendly staff make sure you have a pleasant stay.  The bedroom was clean and well appointed, and sufficiently big enough for me.  The grounds are simple and yet extremely peaceful and tranquil, and after long days out on business it was a welcome sight after the hustle and bustle of the city.  Breakfast is buffet style and there is a good choice of Indian and western style foods.  Omelettes, scrambled eggs, boiled or poached eggs are cooked to order and the waiters kept the toast coming.  There are a couple of restaurant",5
"The  property is so well spread out - like an oasis in the middle of gurgaon . Connects well to the oberoi property and given the high price difference , would recommend staying at the trident and dining at the oberoi . The food at 361 is simply too good - right from the kaali dal to the veg platter to the pizza - all were awesome .  Rooms at the trident are spacious well planned and amazing bathrooms . Pool view room is the best ",5
"Apart from the fact that our room was rather small, everything was perfect.  Upon arrival Ms. Akanksha greeted us with a warm welcome, and made us feel right at home.  She helped us with everything she possibly can, from arranging our rides to the mall, to the airport, and giving us tips on everything we asked for.  Service by all staff members here is excellent.  The landscape here is very dramatic, but calm.  I like the fact that we can go to the Oberoi, where my friends were staying, thru the backdoor.  But, that's when I found out that the rooms are much more spacious at the Oberoi than at the Trident, but slightly more expensive, too.  Overall, an excellent stay and exceptional service by all the staff.  Will definitely come back again if I have a chance to.",4
"The hotel is very well located: outside Delhi at about 20' from the airport, and near the modern city of Gurgaon. The hotel is incredible, the buildings, gardens, pool, spa, interiors When you arrive you stay in shock because of the beauty of the place. And i notice this reaction in all guests that just arrived. The services are excellent. Everything works well: from the check in, room service, concierge, pool bar, spa, laundry. I have to say that the pool is the place i have enjoyed more. And the fact that you can have drinks and food there until the night its a plus. The morning breakfast its a huge buffet with everything you can imagine. I highly recommend this hotel, especially since its really close to Delhi but way calmer.  And choose the rooms w view to the pools! at",5
We stayed here one night at the end of a two week trip travelling around NW India.  It is about 15 minutes from Delhi airport but probably not so convenient for exploring the city itself. We stayed in a more centrally located hotel when we visited Delhi at the start of the trip. Although it is close to the airport and major roads I did not notice much noise. The grounds are substantial and there is a lot of water making it a cool oasis. Facilities are stunning and staff excellent. We ate in the Saffron Indian restaurant. The food was excellent - bordering on fine-dining but the portions were fairly substantial and enough to share between two. Internet is only free for half an hour or by pool bar but was quickest we experienced by far. I thoroughly recommend this hotel.,5
"I arrived in a very grumpy mood after my driver (he was NOT from this hotel) who had overdone Holi, fell asleep twice at the wheel on the highway. The staff were incredibly calming from the start... absolutely incredible in all areas from Varun at reception, to those at the pool, to the restaurants. Quite frankly I wish I could take the bed with me wherever I go in the world - bliss. Loved this hotel and would go back again and again.   The hotel is great and I'd advise anyone needing to be near the airport to stay here rather than the Imperial etc. The airport transfers are a little on the expensive side considering how short a distance it is, but it's a nice Mercedes and the guy didn't fall asleep once, so I was happy!",5
"We could not fault the services of the hotel. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. I felt very comfortable and safe. My wife and I stayed here during a wedding in Delhi. True 5 star hotel, great service and amenities. The perfect place to stay when visiting Delhi.",5
"My wife and I recently travelled to India and landed in New Delhi and found out that the Trident Gurgaon was the perfect place to start our vacation. Our room was absolutely incredible but it was the people who made our stay one of the best. After sleeping for 16 hours we went for breakfast, the head chef Mr. Snadeep and his staff were so kind they taught us about Indian food answered all our questions with amazing manners, attentiveness, and impeccable service. Each evening after touring Delhi we would go to the lounge were a young man named Rohit Yadav would welcome us with the most amazing service, a smile, and such pride in everything he did. Meeting Rohit and his hopefully future wife you will understand why this hotel is simply the best place to stay. The hotel manager Mr.",5
Mostly you will see celebrities staying here. The swimming pool is gorgeous and the gym as well.  The checkin and check out experience was fantastic. The staff were extra-trained to guide you in every aspect.  stayed for 1 night. We had breakfast and a late lunch - both were superb. Made custom dishes during buffet or so - seemed very courteous.,5
"A beautifully appointed hotel located around an exquisitely created water body. Pool facing rooms transport one to a world surrealism,  well trained courteous staff, who anticipate all your needs, a few places where they go the extra mile to make you feel special.",5
"Quite simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. Fabulous, palatial architecture, incredibly friendly and attentive staff, excellent room and restaurants and an atmosphere of pure serenity and positive karma to return to after a full on business day in the crazy bustle of the city. The staff here treat you like royalty - many lovely little touches, like single roses left for you in the room and a hand woven bag made for my shoes left by housekeeping, add to the sheer luxury of it all.  Well equipped, spacious and airy gym, with beauty salon offering a variety of superb treatments & massages adjacent to the pool, which comes with its own poolside bar for that much needed relaxing day at the weekend.   A hotel of this standard would cost you at",5
I was in delhi and I had a few meetings lined up in gurgaon and I wasn't in a mood to travel either in a metro or by a taxi due to traffic issues. I thought better to book myself a hotel in gurgaon. I did my booking with Trident. I booked a taxi and went to trident for my check in. At first I was thoughtful how the place will be and other stuff. I was surprised to see that it was totally in a different world with lots of greenery and minimalistic in its look and decor. The moment I stepped out of my taxi and entered the lobby I was taken to a different world. Simply loved it.  The check in was more personal where in I was seated in a soft couch and was made to sign. I had booked for a deluxe view pool room and when I asked them for an upgradation to the suite room they quickly,5
"As part of a tour group we started our trip with a 3 night stay at Trident, Gurgaon. Wow, what a lovely place to stay, from the greeting at the front gate to the wonderfully comfortable rooms.  Lovely pools and water features make the hotel very special, feeling like a quite resort away from the madness outside the hotel walls. We spent many hours relaxing around the pools to unwind after a long flight, arriving 10pm the first night. Rooms were very spacious with very comfy beds so could get some quality catchup sleep. All the staff were very attentive and pleasing. Only small downside the free wifi doesn‚Äôt work well, very slow and only available near reception or pool bar. Generally we were all pleased with Trident Hotel, and was a really great start to our Indian Tour.",5
Stunning modern take on Taj Mahal type architecture. This is a super-modern hotel but in keeping with traditional India. I was taken here on a business visit for a meal. I regret not staying here. The meal I had was traditional Indian cooking and was a marvelous experience. The setting is stunning. This is 5+ star restaurant. The wines selection is good and well priced. The food is exceptional. The service perfect. I will be coming back as soon as I can.,5
"I just stayed a week at the Trident Gurgaon and cannot imagine staying anywhere else.  This wast my third business trip to Gurgaon over the past 5 months.  My work will now require me to travel to Gurgaon 4 times a year, staying 1 week at a time.  I stayed at the Oberoi on my first visit and the Westin on my second visit.  While the rooms are nicer at the Oberoi, the service was the best at Trident.  The entire staff is so friendly and make you feel at home which is great when you are traveling for work in another country.  On my first night, I was sitting at the bar and Sanjay from Saffron restaurant noticed me and said hello, calling me by name!  I have only met him once when I ate at the restaurant 5 months ago.  I was impressed that not only did he remember me but also",5
To visit this hotel is a real experience. Staff are really friendly without being over intrusive. The actual building is spectacular and the rooms large and really comfortable. There is a pool but we visited in winter so we did not use this. The dining room was spacious and food wonderful and tasty and there was plenty.,5
"I have been a frequent guest over the past years & keep returning. stayed here for 4  nights - this time with two other guests. The Trident is a beautiful relaxing space, quiet yet sensual, away from the bustle of Gurgaon yet near to all the business, shopping & social amenities.  The entire staff team - from the front section to the doormen, cleaners & restaurant team are excellent in what they do.  Their care & consideration for each individual guest is remarkable & this is what brings me back every year. First visit to Delhi or a frequent visitor - give The Trident a try & enjoy the best Delhi can offer.",5
One of the most amazing experience of my life staying in this hotel. The services are extremely prompt and hygienic.  Hospitality is very good. Located in the heart of city in Udyog Vilar. just 30 km away from international airport. All luxury facilities available which you can think of. Overall a resort worth staying. Highly Recommended. ,5
"Stayed here 3 nights, one night in the suite which was amazing with the view of the infinity water feature. Always helpful and attentive staff. Very clean and well kept property. Will stay again on my next trip.",5
We stayed here twice during our holiday. Once at the start and then three days at the end. The hotel is very modern and clean. The breakfasts were fantastic. Service at the bar was very good. We tried two of the three restaurants and they were very good too. The Thali is only available at weekends in the Saffron restaurant and it is fabulous. The pool area is very smart and the staff are very attentive. The hotel is in a business district so you are a little isolated but there is a free transport service to the local shopping mall and for around ¬£40 you can hire a luxury car and a driver for 4 hours. The concierge deserves a special mention too. Why did I knock off a star? Simply because the price of the drinks and food is a bit overpriced.,4
Well located with close access to the highway and most Gurgaon business locations . Beautifully landscaped with pleasing waterbodies and large spaces . Rooms are well appointed and the property has been extremely well maintained. Service is attentive and courteous . There is a lively bar and the coffee shop/ casual dining restaurant offers wide variety of cuisines . Recommended . ,4
"It was my first time I stay at this hotel, everything is perfect, good location for business plan in Gurgaon. The context is peaceful, amazing swimming pool and relax atmosphere. Breakfast is okay, just the right options, dinner has buffet, the only disappointment was, even it is a buffet it has many waiters, but in my opinion not too focus in clients, more focus in clean table, replace buffet dish and prepare the bill. It will be perfect if they ask you for the wine and the bread on time not when you are almost finish your dish... Maybe too busy.. ",4
"This is an amazing hotel, from start to finish the hotel and ensures it gives you a fabulous stay. Numerous staff await your questions and smile 24/7! I ate a breakfast everyday in the restaurant and was pricey but delicious & new selection of pastries to try everyday. The pool looks beautiful but did not have a chance to try it. The bedrooms are vast and have pretty view looking onto the pool. Would love to return! ",5
"We spent a night after a late arrival at Delhi airport, before we moved on to the hustle and bustle of Delhi. This hotel is superb. From our seamless in room check in to our comfortable suite with a lovely view of the reflecting pools, and the caring service of every staff member we encountered, this hotel exceeded all our expectations. This is not a destination hotel for tourists, but I would encourage any discerning traveler to spend time here between domestic flights and definitely allow yourself time to relax and enjoy the beautiful pool areas.",5
We recently stayed 3 nights as part of a tour and found this hotel to be amazing. Our room was perfectly fine but what makes this hotel is the staff. They could not do enough for you and were extremely friendly. The breakfast buffet was lovely. We really enjoyed being taken to the shopping mall in the courtesy car.,5
"Gorgeous hotel- from the offset this was luxury at its finest. would highlight recommend. perfect staff, perfect rooms, perfect service and breakfast. thank you for a wonderful stay trident we will definitely be back!!!",5
"I have stayed here twice now with work and their service is great as you would expect...rooms were nice and clean and lots of water and toiletries provided.  Restaurant was good for breakfast, a wide selection of local and international breakfast (good waffles!) and the menu for dinner also lots to choose from...on our last night my colleague and I enjoyed the pasta and fish & chips!  Quick transfer to the airport as it's close by and the staff are very friendly, nothing is too much trouble.  The housekeeper  left a hand written note offering a gift of a bag for my hair straighteners which was very thoughtful and if they do this for every guest then it reflects their attention to detail for good customer service.  Would come back for future visits.",4
"Awesome property coupled with good food and super efficient staff made our stay totally worth. We had a pool view room. Everything was neat and clean, the staff attended to our needs promptly. The food that we had  ordered from Saffron was good and delicious. We had taken a stroll in their property in the evening. It was an awesome never ending walk in their widespread well maintained property. The following morning, the complimentary american breakfast was an absolute treat in itself. We look forward to visiting this property again and will definitely recommend it our friends and family :)   ",5
"Stayed here a number of times and it never disappoints. within 20min drive from the airport. Great pool for laps, good gym and comfortable rooms. Food in the restaurants is excellent and service throughout is fantastic. I like the no tipping rule with an option of providing tip at end of stay which gets distributed to staff.  If you have to go to Delhi this is a great place to be based. Only negative is they only provide free 30min wifi each day and charge for extra use which is a little silly given what you pay to stay here.",4
We have always admired this fabulous property from the NH during our stay in Gurgaon. So it was a dream come true when our batch decided to have reunion at this resort located conveniently in Gurgaon. We got very good deals.The property is very impressive with serenity all round be it from the water bodies or the manicured lawns. The welcome drink in the form of iced tea was cool. The rooms are very well appointed with good quality toiletries. The staff are very well trained and treat you very well. One of the few hotels in India where the management does not encourage personal tipping. If you want you can leave tips in an envelope and leave with the reception and even write the name of staff if you want. The breakfast is decent.A perfect resort for family getaway. Surprisingly,4
Hotel is located near the heart of Guragon DLF cyber city and very close to IGI airport. Entrance and interior is extremely beautiful. Swimming Pool is a big attraction and rooms are very spacious.Entrance area is giant and gives a luxurious feeling.,5
"I have stayed at the trident a few times ... And wonder why I never penned in a review to celebrate one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in ! I guess the phrase satiated comes to mind !   I am not commenting on the rooms ... They are lovely ... And if you get a deluxe with a view of the pool it is worth every bit ! A relaxing feeling in a very chaotic Gurgoan ... The moment you enter the hotel you get that feeling of a weight being off your shoulders ... And no it is not because of the lovely architecture .. The service from the doorman at the entrance, the reception, the restaurants and even the door men inside just beyond anything you have experienced .. Courteous would be an under statement.   I want to call out specially to the doorman Mohit ... Who remembers the names",5
"An awesome place readily accessible from the main highway. Great food, service with a smile, well appointed rooms and most of all very accomodative. Excellent ambiance and great landscaping. It is amazing that in the middle of the chaos called Gurgaon you can find this retreat.",5
"Have had a fantastic stay, we are currently in the pool bar being served by Anurag who is a fantastic liquid chef with exceptional attention to detail and is a source of good conversation. He is regularly working in the bar and provides consistently exemplary service. ",5
"A serene oasis that is impossible to imagine when you turn off the traffic-choked streets of Gurgaon, the Trident (and its sister hotel Oberoi next door) is an amazingly calm, low-slung hotel with lovely modern water pools, greenery and spotless corridors and modern ambience. The service is very friendly, the rooms and mid-sized and comfortable. The bar right by the lobby is small and the music can be over the top loud and hard to have a lot of non-yelling conversations. The buffet breakfast and lunch restaurant is quite terrific. The expensive (a 90 minute massage with all taxes comes to about $150) is set by the pool but the deep tissue massage was no more than a rub-down and one of the most disappointing especially for that price. The front desk is friendly and like all fancy",4
"The Hotel view is very beautiful and his staff members communications is very nice. I advice, please must be visit there. Food quality is very good, room neat and clean. Shopping mall is near by. Locality is very nice.",5
Overall very silent and comfortable place. Great Staff. The water bodies within the hotel makes the entire setting a calm and peaceful place right in the middle of the city. Breakfast options are also extensive.,5
"I stayed at Trident Gurgaon for 11 nights in January 2016, on a business trip. I have all good things to say about my stay experience. Hospitality of the hotel is beyond comparison. They went out of their way to make my long stay comfortable. Maintenance of the property is top class. Wifi speed is excellent. Rooms are very cosy and comfortable. The restaurant menu gets monotonous; however, the chefs went out of their way and made custom-made dishes for me. All in all, it was an excellent stay. I am booked again in this hotel in February for another 4 nights, and I look forward to staying with them again.",5
I stayed in this hotel for a weekend. My experience was simply excellent. I have never experienced so much of quiet and peace in any hotel that I have stayed. It is in the middle of the city on a very busy road and there is no noise that gets into this property. I as completely blown over by the experience of serenity and calm. It was rejuvenating.,5
This property scores a perfect 10 on all fronts. Reception was great right and was escorted straight to the room where they did the check in formalities. The rooms are excellent with all modern amenities. The layout of the property is wonderful with all rooms on the ground floor. I had a garden facing room and it was excellent. Food is great and multiple restaurants offer you a great choice of food. 20 minutes from the Delhi International airport makes it very convenient for Business travelers.,5
"We spent our last night in India here.  The hotel is very modern and very pleasing to the eyes as you enter the grounds (we got here after dark and the lighting was very impressive).  Rooms are reasonable in size and clean.  The bed was comfortable.  The buffet breakfast was very good, although service refilling coffee was a bit on the slow side.  The pool was beautiful and clean, and the gym was excellent.    It is located near the airport, but there was no noise from the airport.",5
"We stayed here one night with a tour group.  We were basically given rooms to rest for a few hours before our international departures, which was great.  There are lovely areas in the hotel but the lobby is very modern and cold looking to me.  The rooms are nice enough, clean, and the pool of water right up to the window in my room was so pretty.  However, the evening we stayed there, there was a big party with music blaring all through the common areas from the conference rooms and the bar and what seemed like strobe lights. I prefer a more calming atmosphere. They should be more considerate of the other guests and not allow that loud noise in the lobby area.  I don't know if parties such as these are held often,  maybe we were just unlucky on timing. The hotel is convenient to",4
One of the best places I have ever stayed in Delhi. Clean.. excellent and well trained staff.. fantastic food... very accommodative of the needs.. and open to talk and take feedback.. have never seen this kind of a special service anywhere else...  Keep up the good work,5
"This hotel sets out to be attentive, polite, welcoming and a shelter, and it succeeds. So clean it smells of polish, such good service that there are multiple members of staff you remember and so memorable because its an oasis in a storm of pollution.",5
"What a stunning and unique hotel. Really lovely staff, unbelievably comfortable beds and rooms, and a fab breakfast. Couldn't ask for anything more for a night before a flight home. Highly recommended.",5
"My wife and I were here for two nights at the end our India tour. It is a wonderful bit of luxury with a tranquil beautiful setting that makes you forget about all the chaos of New Delhi that surrounds.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and the food, especially at Saffron restaurant was some of the best we had on our trip",5
"Excellent hotel. Water front room is too good. Professional staff, kitchen too good and makes food of your choice specially when you have small kids with you. Noiseless rooms and spotless interiors makes stay very comfortable , willing to come back.",5
Was here on a business trip for a few days from UK with my wife. Smooth collection from airport to the hotel. Definitely a nice relaxing place to stay compared to the vibrant surroundings.  There was plenty to do. Easy access to swimming pool. Made use of room service quite a lot because of some of the odd hours I was unexpectedly forced to work. Would definitely go to this hotel again.,4
"Gurgaon/ NCR is home to me so I basically don't get to stay at hotels. This was a trip organized keeping in mind 8 business meetings spread across 2 days, late evenings with a LOT of alcohol and barely any time for a nap.   Friends recommended this property strongly and I got the bookings sorted. Here is a snipet-  A courtesy pick-up after a 5 hours flight delay in a brand new C Class chauffered by probably one of the first drivers who I would have rated a 9 on 10 for his spoken English. The feel on stepping inside the property just kept getting better- they have a huge entrance and I was escorted straight to my room, no check-in formalities, nothing. The trainee who escorted me to my room did an excellent job at walking me through the facilities and gave me directions-a",5
I was there for lunch the other day and the buffet spread was so amazing just that I reached there a little late and the buffet timings were about to get over I had to order from the menu. The presentation of the food and the quality and the quantity everything was appropriate. The food tasted very well and staff was extremely polite and humble,5
"With wonderful rooms and awesum food, this place is fantastic with kids..very friendly staff and baby sitters!! The breakfast spread is just amazing..the location is gr8 too.. Has open access to Oberoi next door for fine dinning and some retail therapy!! Just perfect!!",4
"Excellent service, rooms and food. Hotel staff very helpful and nice.  Great pool.  View and decorations are great. Be careful with using transportation provided at hotel so you are not experiencing any overcharges you do not expect.",5
"This hotel is truly amazing - the staff are accommodating and welcoming, the grounds are beautiful, and the rooms are extremely clean.  I've travelled extensively in Europe and Asia and this is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed in.  The location is a little less ideal if you're planning to spend the majority of your time in Delhi, but if you're working in Gurgaon, I would definitely recommend it.",5
"unlike the other high rise 5 star properties, this hotel is spread over a large area and has ample open space. the rooms are amazing and the staff courteous. i loved our dinner at saffron and the breakfast buffet at cilantro was incredible too. i would recommend trident for a stay. do check out their gym, pool, and spa.",5
Stayed here barely a day but loved it. The grounds are stunning and the staff could not be more accommodating. Rooms are modern and luxurious. Great beds. The main dining room has an excellent menu. Everyone working here is eager to please guests.  All the above adds up to a great hotel near the airport.,5
Felt great right after stepping into the hotel.  The scent at the lobby relaxed me and I felt so comfortable sitting there while waiting for my room to be ready.  The room and hotel compound were so clean.  A nice place to return to after returning from the busy streets.  The staffs were very helpful and greeted the guests whenever we met.  They provided me with good advices regarding the metro and the transfer to the airport.    I have only taken dinner once at the restaurant.  Food was just alright but the service was great.    The only con was that the free wifi is only available at the pool.  ,4
"Just stopped by the hotel, but it is beautiful. Everything about it agrees with the 5 star rating. Definitely check it out if you are in the area. When you walk in, there is a fire pool with reflections that just makes you aware you are in the right place.",5
The grounds of this hotel are amazing.  The pool area is just so.  The service is excellent.  The rooms are very comfortable and spacious.  The meals are very tasty and there is plenty of it.  A wonderful stay.  We arranged to have a car take the 3 couples on a tour around Delhi and the cost very reasonable.  highly recommended but then you pay for it.,5
"We got a chance to stay at the Trident property in Gurgaon this week. It was a real delight to reach there and see the most beautiful stylish architecture of this hotel. It stands apart from most hotels in a modern city and amongst all other Trident Hotels too! The walk into the hotel and the lobbies, the gardens and the pretty courtyards that are strewn all around, embellished with palm or cactii are a soothing sight.  The walk to the rooms is rather long though and maybe they should provide air boards to swish away to the rooms that take forever to reach! In that aspect the layout is quite tedious.  But the service and kindness of staff is commendable. Polite helpful and always smiling, the housekeeping(Sandeep), restaurant(Tanmay) staff & others made our stay so comfortable.",5
"Stayed at The Oberoi next door but visited the restaurants and bars here and had a little look round at the pool etc.... a beautiful hotel.   The service in the bar and restaurant was excellent and the public areas of the hotel, including gardens and pool, looked superb.  Will be visiting Gurgaon again in a few months time and The Trident is on my list of hotels to try out.",5
Stayed here for the last night of recent tour of India and having arrived late afternoon only wished we had more time to spend here.  Rooms are beautiful and the area around the pool is lovely after dark when they light the torches and lanterns on the steps leading down to it.  Gym is well equipped and staff very friendly and eager to assist in whatever way they can.  Food at dinner and breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice at both meals.  Drinks were expensive though probably because the hotel is geared towards business clients being in the business district of Delhi.,5
"We had a terrible experience at a party organised, the food and the service was good but it was spoiled by the 2 hour wait outside in cold just to retrieve your car. The valet service was mismanaged and incompetent to say the least. There were at least 200 people waiting, maybe equal to around 100 cars. The slips were missing, they did not have any emergency plan in place to at least make people comfortable, while they put in additional resources, even communication was lacking. I would never recommend people to visit this hotel again.",1
Just got back from a week at the trident.  Service was exceptional and the facilities were beautiful.  I have to compliment the staff in particular who were exceptionally attentive to supporting my stay morning and evening.  Particular thanks to Rohit who made sure I had a good working environment  every evening at the restaurant.,5
This is truly an amazing property.  If you have never traveled to India/New Delhi/Gurgaon... trust me when I say that this hotel is a welcome spot of calm within the otherwise chaotic environment.  The staff members are extremely kind and attentive.  The setting is beautiful- gorgeous architecture and grounds.  And you have to walk through the pool area by day and by night.,5
I would rate this property to be one of best place to stay for business travellers and for tourist. I would rate this in top three 5 star hotel i have ever stayed.It gives you feel of staying in palace. Good food and great breakfast. Rooms are big and has all that one can expect from 5 star property. Swimming pool is too good and one can be there for hours together. Good staff and really take care of you. The only negative is it's expensive. If you get good offer then just book it ! ,5
"This is a wonderful hotel that is 5 star anywhere. Rooms are clean, spacious and extremely comfortable with many amenities. The site is beautifully laid out the only downside being that there are plenty of steps on the outside journey but there is a flat inside route. The swimming pool is a good size with plenty of poolside chairs and tables. The staff are very helpful and prepared to go that extra distance to make the stay enjoyable. Courtesy car is available for local journeys to Shopping Malls and restaurants. The food was, as to be expected, first class with a range that would satisfy any palate.Wifi is available free for 30 minutes per day which we found sufficient for our needs. You can pay for all day wifi. Restaurant staff were attentive without being overly so. All in",5
"This is the second year we have stayed at The Trident at Gurgaon on our last night in India.  The hotel is about 15 miles from the centre of Delhi, but is very close to the International airport.  If you want expensive shopping their sister Oberoi Hotel is next door and inter-connected.  We ate very well and to our great joy found the swimming pool heated.  The room is very comfortable and has tea/coffee facilities.  My big bud bear is they give only 30 minutes free wi-fi then charge heavily for the privilege.  Would get 5 stars except for the wi-fi",4
"Proper 5 star service people,food, service.  One of the best hotels and restaurant combinations I have visited.  Chef Mohan was particularly good, the restaurant food was excellent and nothing too much trouble (even ordering of menu). You will need to use the local cars (short distance complimentary) to get anywhere but its a good location withn easy reach of Delhi.",5
It's a business class hotel . very nice hotel. Staff is very caring and helpful. Hotel is very beautiful in night as compare to morning. Pool view is very nice. Wow experience there. Must revisit .food is very delicious and served with in 15-20min.must revisit ,5
"Was here for a business trip, but had to resist the urge to slip into vacation mode. The hotel is straight up - beautiful. Super interesting architecture as soon as you step in. Looks completely different by night and day. The pool view from the room window feels like you're actually standing in the pool. Very cool.  The rooms are pretty big but do have some odd furniture - especially lamps - that feel out of place. While the layout of the hotel is great - they do need to think of the little things like having power outlets near the bed. Slightly annoying to have to unplug the clock to simply charge your phone. Food was great. Really enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Can't fault the service. Good folks who looked after us very well through out our stay.",5
We stayed here at the end of  a 2 week trip to India just to rest for a few hours in between our domestic and international flights. It is a very modern interesting hotel. It wowes you on arrival. It was originallly built to be an Oberoi and then became the flagship Trident after they built the more glityz Oberoi next door. Both hotels are connected and it is worth the walk to see the Oberoi with its shopping arcade and basement delicatessan next door. If you like chocolate try some in the delicatesssan of the Oberoi it is quite good. Both hotels have beautiful swimming pools. The Trident is less than a half hour from the airport even with traffic. We had dinner here and it was as good as all the food in the Oberoi chain. I think this is an excellent choice if you have business,5
I stayed here for a few nights before starting a tour of Rajastan. The hotel is located fairly near to the airport and a distance from the centre of town . There is shopping nearby though at Ambience Mall. The architecture of the hotel is very striking with great use of water features. Rooms are very comfortable but not overly large. Great pool area and staff were very helpful. Very good food and a choice of restaurants.,5
"As a regular Trident guest and having stayed here again recently as part of a trip to India that included two other 5 star hotels what was clear to me was that the standard of service provided to guests at the Trident remains unmatched by most other Indian hotels. I am sure that all Indian hotels train their staff well but at the Trident it feels that the staff genuinely want you to have a good stay and will do anything they can to make it happen.That said a couple of observations since my last stay, i am not a fan of the loud music that is now played in the bar, you can hardly hold a conversation with the person next to you. Also it would be great if the menu in the main restaurant was changed from time to time, i think it has remained unchanged for the last couple of years. It",4
"Everything about this hotel emitted style from the elegant large bedroom to the reception to the restaurant.Ideal for business with an extremely well stock large desk in bedroom but it did lack comfort,as beautiful the arm chair and bed were they were not as comfortable as stylish.My view from window was very poor. The food looked amazing but again the taste did not quite live up to the very high expectations.There was also a mix up with our party which did mean we had to carry our food from one restaurant into the restaurant next door. The staff were very helpful in opening doors for us. The grounds were breathtaking.With water everywhere,they made you feel tranquil and fully rested from the busy city.The pool was lovely,but it did lack sun beds.At night there was delightful",5
"Stayed here for a conference. Large room, very aesthetically decorated. Food is excellent, esp Thai dishes. Nice to walk around, with lush lawns and good landscaping. The numerous water bodies add to the grace. Specially the huge water body at the front becomes magical in the evening after fire torches are lit in it. ",5
"Stayed at the Trident Hotel for 5 nights on a work trip and can't really fault the hotel at all - it's great and highly recommended.   The staff are amazing and can't do enough to help you. I checked out (late) from the hotel but came back to have a drink whilst waiting for my flight and the hotel staff gave me a room to change in - brilliant service!   Hotel facilities are great too - nice pool, well equipped gym, friendly bar and the buffet breakfast was nice with a good choice. We ate out at Cyber Hub most nights which is just a 10 minute walk from the hotel but be careful as traffic is nuts!   The room was good with everything you need and very comfy beds!   Good location for Gurgaon but quite far out from Delhi - we travelled in by metro train which was super cheap but over",5
When you arrive in the property it is not expected to get such a quiet and  peaceful resort . You can even hear birds chirping and many pigeons around . The restaurants are fabulous they have live music in there restaurants and bars . The property has avery unique architecture  ,4
"Excellent property with superb service and equally good foodüëç  Must try is their Indian restaurant!!  Located in Udyog Vihar, its very close to the IT hub of Gurgaon and malls.   Excellent place for both business and personal visits.   Cheers, Dheeraj ",5
"India did not steel my heart, but the Trident (part of Oberoi and Oberoi Gurgaon next door) and it's staff certainly did!! We travel all over the world and it's hard to find hotels with this standard of hygiene and service. We were treated as royals without staff being submissively.  If you want to go shopping within 5 km of the hotel, complementory transport with a hotel car will be arranged. For a (half) day trip a luxurious car with experienced driver (really need that in Indian traffic hell) can be hired.  And we really appreciated the upgrade to an executive suite!",5
"There are some hotels that just connect; everything fits, you actually believe that you are the most important person at that moment and wonder upon wonder, the staff take the trouble to remember you, you are their personal guest. From the moment of arrival, that fact that they greet you by name from the car, the fact that the front of house staff do so too, and all the way through your stay staff make it clear that they have not forgotten your name or that you are important, their guest, that nothing is too much trouble, means that this hotel is special. Room, lovely, good use of space. Whole hotel, good use of space and height, an oasis really. Food exceptional, service exceptional, hotel exceptional. My only regret was that, as this was a business trip, it was not possible to",5
"Went to India with my husband for the 1st time and stayed in this Hotel. My 1st impression of the hotel service was a bit down when we arrived at the airport.We booked airport pick up from the hotel because we arrived in early morning. Our flight was delayed for an hour and the queueing for the immigration took ages and its a bit annoyed us when we cant find the driver who supposed to pick up us after such a long journey!We only saw our name tag hanging without any sight of the staff. After wandering around looking for them without any clue, finally someone came and said he will looking for the driver.After waited for 15 minutes the driver finally show up and took us the hotel. Thats a bit  disappointing from what we expected but we were just glad we finally made to the hotel.",4
"If you are going to India for business and if your meetings are in Gurgaon, I would strongly recommend that you stay in a hotel in that area. Traffic can be a nightmare and you don't want to spend 90 minutes a day stuck in the car between New Delhi and Gurgaon. The Trident is located 20 to 30 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from Cyber Hub which is the main business area in Gurgaon. The hotel architecture is very interesting, the facilities and rooms are great. Outside is chaos, inside is peace and tranquility with on top a great staff.",5
"Have stayed here twice in the past 2 months, and must say the experience has been really fabulous.  Pros- stunning hotel rooms, great gym and large swimming pool, fantastic service, good food at the bar and breakfast  Cons- well, actually none... (a bit largish, so one has to walk a bit)",5
"I have now been twice to this hotel with 6 years in between, and both times the service and quality of the hotel totally stands out as excellent. Food, rooms, and the fantastic personal attention is truly outstanding. I want to go back already!",5
"This hotel is unreal!!  Massive grounds around 118 ultra modern rooms. Water pools surround the property.  Our room looked out on a huge pool.  Cilantro, their restaurant was great. Lots of business meetings happening in the bar and at the tables. What a pleasant surprise.",5
"Rooms are perfect and clean, the shower is good. I think the bathtub needed a bit more cleaning. The restaurants have a good variety of food, not only Indian. Breakfast is wonderful. Best thing in the hotel is the pool, take some time to relax and forget about life. When going to the spa, prefer not to have the body scrub, I found it a bit rough. The staff is very polite and always eager to help you with anything you need.  The architecture is what differentiates the hotel from a traditional global chain, it sort of looks like a modern Taj Mahal. I strongly recommend you stay there.",5
"This hotel is the India of imagination rather than reality.  It was delightful.  As you enter the grounds, you leave all the dust and noise behind and you are in a different world.  We spent our last day in India by the pool relaxing and recovering from our 3 week tour.  The only thing that would have improved the time there was to have more shopping options.  There were very expensive stores which offered French and European brands, but almost nothing Indian and nothing affordable for souvenirs.  The food was very good, especially the dinner buffet on our first night with an assortment of Indian dishes.",4
"This property is located in heart of gurgaon so close to cyber city... Hotel is good , staff is well mannered...Food is awesome...swimming pool & fitness centre is quite maintained..best thing i loved about pool is that evening they light the mashals around it and the overall atmosphere become so indulging.... Rooms are quite spacey with all the amenity required..",4
"This is my second stay at the Trident, and it fully matched the standards of my first visit.  It is a very convenient drive to and from the Airport (warning - but not to the centre of Delhi) with the help of some very experienced dedicated drivers. Its dominant water features creates a calm and peaceful ambiance.   The staff were universally courteous and efficient, with the one issue in my room being dealt with within five minutes of reporting the fault. The communal areas are bright and impeccably clean. We took a very good quality meal at the restaurant, and the food kept coming until we admitted defeat.   Staff should be mindful of the noise levels when they are checking in guests for the inevitable early warning arrivals, and I would expect free Wi-Fi for the price of the",4
"A great place to stay while transiting through New Delhi. The hotel is close to the airport and provided excellent services (swimming pool and message). The cafe, Saffron served some of the best Indian cuisines and not to be missed. The only downside is the hotel could be crowded if there are functions going on (corp. or wedding).",5
"This  hotel is very well- located for the airport and Gurgaon but feels far more than a business hotel - imaginatively designed with a lovely pool, charming ambience and sevice and first rate food - the chef even gave us an Indian cookery book. We stayed for three nights and loved it.",5
I was on a business trip in Delhi for a night and chose to stay at the Trident as it was close to my event location. This is a breathtaking property and very well maintained. You are greeted by a grand arrival space which leads into the beautiful water structure in the entrance. This is followed by the equally well designed reception and hotel. The check in was reflective of the high quality of the brand of Trident. My conveniences were taken care of. The rooms are slightly smaller in size than expected but easy on the eyes. The room had a view to the beautiful pool area. Excellent furnishings adorn the decor of the room. The wireless internet which was complimentary was of excellent quality with no drops in connection. The food is undoubtedly expensive but associated with,5
"The service was superb. The hotel was clean and the staff incredibly helpful and attentive. I found the staff very friendly and willing to assist in any way to make guests feel comfortable (for example, they kindly arranged for a prescription to be filled for me when I was ill). Also, the surroundings are beautiful. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in Gurgaon. ",5
"On a whirlwind business travel this August, I was hopping cities and hotels. While in Gurgaon, I stayed a night at the Trident Gurgaon. Now, like a typical business traveller, I only had a little over my condensed sleeping hours to absorb an experience of staying with them. Did I leave impresses? Oh yes and how!  As your car enters the porch your visual senses start to salivate. A huge sandstone arch and a few happy faces welcome you to The Trident Gurgaon. The next 70 meter walk to the lobby takes you around a humongous water body that adorns the hotel property - a rarest element to any hotel in the prime location of a metro city.   A Trident Privilege member, an express check-in was facilitated allowing me those precious extra minutes to freshen up before dashing out to the",5
"My only regret was that my stay was so short that I did not truly experience everything this glorious hotel had to offer to its privileged guests. Overall a luxurious resort with a fascinating design (I believe Moroccan inspired) and fantastic service. Rooms were very good, nothing amazing but very comfortable.  Pros: - visually stunning hotel - extremely high quality customer service and all around consistency - only had breakfast but high quality - gorgeous outdoor pool, wish I had the chance to use it - felt very secure, due to the necessary security procedures to enter the grounds  Cons: - car pick up from the hotel was complimentary but would have been good to know ahead of time that it would need to be shared. Therefore, quite a long wait for the other passenger due to",5
"It was my wonderful visit with my husband.it was our candlelight dinner. It was amazing. Hotel was superb. We enjoyed a lot.it was too hygienic , service was very nice, quickly. It was our unbelievable memory.",5
Great rooms. Great service. Great food. Great facilities? Wifi is excellent. Gym and pool are first class. Stayed there for several days whilst on a business trip as very close to our Asia Pacific office. Highly recommended.,5
"Truely heaven, while entering Trident, one must be sooo surprised to see the doom!!! Luxury is what I can say, awsum experience, awsum ambience, awsum food, awsum rooms!!! Realxing at pool means relaxing at Heaven!!! Just 5 min drive from ambience mall!!! Advice to Stay in garden view room!!!",5
We stayed the the trident Gurgaon for a family wedding... Excellent property... The lagoon facing rooms are very nice and we felt totally relaxed... The trident food was also excellent...  We also went to the oberio property for  coffee at their restaurant 360 degrees... What an amazing place...  ,5
Awesome Property with beautiful views. Great Interiors with well maintained lawns. Beautiful Entry to the hotel with magnificent water body and vast lawns. The swimming pool surrounded by rooms and SPA is the star attraction .,5
I have stayed at the Trident a few times now on business and it is lovely.  Beautiful peaceful setting away from the hubub of Gurgaon with staff that are ever attentive and polite.  I just find it a little sterile and characterless.  I should try teh sister hotel Oberoi because I have heard that is better.  I also prefer the opulence of the Leela.  Nothing wrong though.,4
"Trident is the old world option compared to the very flashy Oberoi. The service is more traditional and elegant. Chances are you will only eat breakfast and room service if you arrive at an odd time. Both offer excellent food. The rooms are very, very quiet especially the suites. All staff are fluent in English and exceedingly polite. Trident is highly recommended for business travelers. Typically Gurgaon is not a vacation destination, but if for some reason you are here on holiday you might prefer the Oberoi. It's styled as a luxury resort with shopping, spa services, and a general party atmosphere. The two properties are connected so it is possible to enjoy both during one trip",4
"I don't usually make the effort of writing reviews (infact this is only my second time) but i felt so indebted to the friendly staff and the delicious food that i took the effort of highlighting it. The restaurant helped me set up a special table outdoors to celebrate my girlfriend's bday, got it decorated with flowers & candles. They made an exception to their policy without hesitating which was extremely pleasing. The concerned guy (Tanuj) stayed in touch with me all day, even sent me pics after decorating the table for my approval. It was this genuine hospitality that we rarely see; left me appreciating and smiling till the end.  The Hotel overall is nothing short of spectacular and way different than other contemporary hotels; high ceilings, Egyptian achitecture, mystical",5
"The hotel overall is amazing and staff just wonderful. Breakfast is to die for whether you like Indian, continental or american style all your needs are met. Rooms are very nice (we did not get one with the pool view that would have really made the room fantastic) but not the nicest I have ever stayed at....but by all means nothing to complain about.  The pool....aaahhhhh the pool....it is by far the most relaxing pool I have been to on any continent. Dark blue tile, with the shallow decorative pools above spilling over a wall that gives the constant sound of falling water. Amazing",5
"What a fantastic two days!! Stayed there with my family recently and they can't stop raving about this property. Personally for me, it's been a very special stay since it was my fathers birthday and also because of my siblings being away at college , the whole family was getting together after quite a while. The service is by far one of the best experiences I have had especially at Indian hotels. From the staff at the pool , restaurants , IRD to the front office, they were all genuinely forthcoming and just plain wonderful.  The property itself is quite a lovely oasis and takes away from the feeling of being in Gurgaon. Landscapes are beautiful and the architecture and layout is gorgeous. I especially loved the water bodies they have all over the property. It was amazing waking",5
"Trident is one of the best hotels in Gurgaon. The building and the gardens are beautifuls. They have a fantastic swimmingpool and a complere gym. The rooms are big enough with all the details for the guest. The breakfast and restaurants are fantastic. And i would like to mention specially the service, they are great! ",5
"i have been here almost monthly this year, sometimes for a single night, other times for a fortnight at a time. the experience starts with the quaintly serious uniformed guards saluting your entrance, continues with a quite serious security check, and then the seriously beautiful urban oasis experience kicks in.   the entrance to the hotel is around a gorgeous, huge pool, with naked lamps dancing on the surface in the evening, and the foyer is beautiful with high ceilings and cool marble - and it's also at reception that the best part of the Trident Gurgaon is revealed - the staff.   i travel globally, have been traveling for the past 35 years, to places high and low, from no stars to seven star hotels, but i have never met such unceasingly polite, graceful, charming and helpful",5
The Trident is an amazing hotel.  The property is beautiful and the pool area is one of the most beautiful places I  have ever seen.  The staff could not be nicer or more helpful.  I chose this hotel because of the location but I was very pleasantly surprised to find this is truly a 5 star hotel with 5 star service.  I would put the Trident up against any similar property around the world any day of the week.  I was visiting for business but I would definitely recommend it to to anyone.  The Trident made working feel like a vacation.,5
I have been very much happy staying in this hotel. As i was far from my home but i felt very much homely in this hotel. The staff is so much friendly from gate till they take you in the room. I recommend this hotel to everyone.,5
"We been to with our client for dinner. Architecture is really nice, we love the pool out side and service excellent. But when it comes to food, the taste wasnt that good but quality was excellent. We been to north Indian restaurant  called Saffron.",5
"One of the best hotels ive ever stayed at. Supremely attentive staff, excellent facilities, excellent breakfast and other services. Have stayed on 3 occasions over the past few months, from the second visit the staff started recognising me, and always went out of their way to be of service. Will certainly stay again, and look forward to seeing if other Trident hotels are up to the same mark!",5
"Attentive, helpful, nicely appointed rooms, staff v keen to help wherever possible; for business traveller convenient to key business districts. Gym and pool well equipped and providing a welcome break from the inevitable traffic of Delhi",5
"Stayed here for 10 nights on a business trip and have to say it was a great choice.  Step inside this hotel and you will be impressed, there is a lot of space, peace and quiet, large bedrooms, very impressive breakfast choices.  By far the best attribute of this hotel is the staff, they are so helpful, and they really make a difference to ensure your stay is comfortable.  The dining & drinks are on the higher end but the dining rooms and bar are visually stunning.   Pool area and gym are also very impressive and the staff really look after you.",5
The room are clean and the hotel  building is beautiful. For long its been the best hotel in gurgaon now joined at the top position with the Oberoi hotel. A place where you will enjoy your stay and they will make you feel good.,5
Beautiful hotel with great staff. Excellent service from all staff.   Most definitely stay again given the opportunity. Great food too in all the restaurants with lots of choice at all sittings. I stayed for business but this hotel would be great for pleasure too.  ,5
"This is one hotel in Delhi where I have stayed god knows how many times. The entrance is great and grand, and the hotel staff is courteous, the food was good. However over the past few years am seeing the service of the hotel has slowly started degrading. I remember once earlier the room service food was late by 2 mins and they did not charge for the food and had apologized 10 times. Now you would be lucky if they sent food even 10 mins after their given time. Many times I would have asked them for 2 plates of Phulkas which is 6 pieces but they will invariably send one which is 3 pieces and then once told they will rush back again for one more (3 pieces). As the hotel is a huge complex it takes time for them to deliver things.",3
"The Trident Hotel, which serves people flying out of the New Delhi airport, is not just any airport hotel!  It is beautiful, dramatic, and modern, with multiple infinity pools luminous blue in color.  When my husband and I were there in April of 2013, we were struck by how luxurious and enormous the hotel was.  We walked quite a way to our room, which was very comfortable and well appointed.  The restaurant, Cilantro, was very attractive. I can‚Äôt say what we had for dinner because I did not write it down in my journal, but I do recall that the meal was delicious and well served.  At the appointed 2:00 AM time (necessary for us make our early morning plane), our wake-up call came, and shortly thereafter tea and biscuits were brought to the room, and shortly after that a bellman",5
"I have been to several hotels in India, but the service at the Trident was the best I have ever experienced in all my business and personal travels. I was made to feel special every day from a doorman constantly relieving me of bag so I could have breakfast unencumbered to the restaurant manager greeting me by name and the chef taking the time to introduce me to Indian food. I wanted to spend the weekend in Simla and the concierge was just outstanding. The duty manager walked me through all my options and arranged everything for me. Since I chose to take the bus at an unfamiliar city, I was pleasantly surprised when one of the duty managers showed up at the station to ensure I got on board safely. On one of the days I was coming back from the office, I tested the Hindi phrases I",5
"Trident fur gain pretty much continues the Oberon service excellence. You are taken care of, feel to made special.  About 15 to 20 min from international airport, hotel Is Known for good food - continental, Japanese and Indian cuisine. Great spa and above all a superlative service experience.  Great Indian food, check out chef saudamini.   Great breakfast layout, pristine pool and fully functional gym.   Great time.   ",5
"Absolutely lives by its reputation of providing phenomenal service. The housekeeping staff (Sudha) left a toy when she came to know there was a baby staying in the room. Each and every member of the staff is extremely courteous. The attention to detail is mind boggling. Hotel is neat and clean , well maintained. Food is great. In the middle of gurgaon here is an amazing hotel which is a must stay ! My first experience with the trident makes me want to come back again for more ! Loved it ! I'm still not done with my stay but I couldn't help posting the review. ",5
We have been to many hotels all over India but nothing compared to this one! Amazing rooms and very courteous service! The kitchen staff was also very helpful. They suggested us different food items which we absolutely loved ! I couldn't have asked for more !,5
"This is an incredible hotel.  The rooms are magnificent, comfy and spacious with quick Wi-Fi.  The grounds (as you will see from the photos) are peaceful and beautiful.    Fantastic service, nothing is too much for the good people here - even an embarrassing mistake where I erred when coding the safe and had my passport locked in it 15 minutes before I had to check out was handled with quiet efficiency.  All the staff were extremely helpful.  Security was very good and you felt safe and like you were in a sanctuary.  It was a wonderful hotel, the only pity was that I spent very little time there due to my business commitments.  I'd love to go back with my lovely wife and really enjoy the place at leisure",5
It was my anniversary cum birthday weekend getaway. The hotel staff made sure they lived by their slogan 'we create memories.'  We went with our 4 year old and not a single staff member left any stone unturned in giving us the best comforting stay. Would recommend this hotel chain a must experience even when you travel with your children.  Thank you to each person working so hard to make people feel like royalty.,5
"We stayed at the Trident for the second time in July, again staying twice for one night each time at the end of the India part of our holiday and then following our Sri Lanka part ahead of our flight back home.  Ahead of our stay the Trident team were very accommodating by allowing us to store our excess bags 2 days before we were due to check in. Then again we did the same as we headed to Sri Lanka.  The pick up from the airport was smooth, 2 very nice Audi A6 transferred us to the hotel, both drivers were courteous and made us feel welcome during the short drive.  Check in was again a painless task. The rooms we booked were Superior Deluxe and were well appointed with the space and quality of fittings top notch.  As we moved around the hotel the staff remembered our names and",5
I stayed at the hotel for 5 night.at 18 - 23 july. I think is Very recomended hotel..perfect hotel..nice room..nice staff..good location near from indira gandhi airport..amazing architecture Feels like home,5
"Overall, a wonderful place for a quick break.  Positives: Pretty place, lovely architecture, beautiful lilies replaced everyday, decent rooms, breakfast spread, overall restaurant menu spread, hospitality of staff all across, ease of check-in. There were a few celebrities in the hotel at the same time and even when we were sitting in the same restaurant, there was no dip in service for others. That was unusual to see in India. I could go on and on...  Negatives: Really difficult to list anything here :)",5
"On our last stop on our two week journey, my son and I spent 2 days here and it was a great send-off to our perfect adventure to India!  We were graciously greeted and treated.  Even sous-chef, Mohan Soni, made us feel like royalty with her magnificent sushi and generous hospitality.  My son and I topped off our regal trip with a fun-filled evening experience only to wake to a delicious breakfast buffet!  Our tears will be camouflaged with the monsoon rain‚Ä¶must return!",5
"I was in staying in Trident Regency for 3 days for a business trip in May 2015 the hotel captured my heart with it's layout..... the layout is the prime attraction of the hotel. The hotel has only two storeys and it's almost spread like a resort. But everything chic that a resort lacks, Trident has it.   The staff is extremely courteous and hospitable. I fell sick on the second night, and they took care of me like I was at home. The Chef - Saudamini would call me not only to ask me what I would like to eat but also advise me on some healthy dishes that she said she would especially make for me..... at the end of the stay, the Chef came to my room and presented me with a lovely green scarf from Fab India. That was such a sweet gesture. Well, even if you don't read my review, do",5
"Stayed here for 3 nights during a recent trip to Delhi.  This hotel is as near to perfection as a hotel can get.   The staff, food, room are all everything anyone could want.  Can't wait to go back!   Our first night we checked in around midnight, even at that late hour all the staff was as helpful as they could be.  We needed to get a breakfast to take away.  Again- no problem at all for the excellent dining room staff.   Stored baggage- no problem.  Spotless facility and simply stunning building.  ",5
"Stayed here as my wife was travelling on business and I wanted to visit India while she was there. Can honestly say that the customer service provided by all the staff was brilliant. Without exception every member of staff I interacted with were friendly, helpful and seemed to have my wellbeing and satisfaction as their primary goal. Most people staying here were there for business so I had the beautiful pool area pretty much to myself during the day. The waiters made sure I always had a bottle of cold water, cool flannels, etc as well as Kingfisher beer and snacks. In the evenings, when my wife joined me back in the hotel after work, we enjoyed the cocktails in the main bar, which for some reason were cheaper than the same ones at the pool bar. We were always treated to that",5
Excellent place to visit and nice buffet. Thanks to trip advisor for the suggestion. I will definitely recommend your site and your app to my friends. Its easy to use and you get the best options for your trip.,5
"More than the room in this hotel I liked the overall theme, layout, architecture, design and service in this hotel. The view around the swimming pool is just awesome! The hotel is having only one level (may be one section has two levels). So I think there will be quite a limited number of rooms. Overall it gives nice royal but boutique feel at the same time. Service is great and staffs are very well groomed. Two things which I think could have been better. Since all the rooms are at level 1, people walking in the corridor can easily see inside the room, if the curtains are open. Secondly, I found a the corridors are quite noisy till very late in the night. My colleague staying in another room had the same issue. May be a one off during those nights.  WiFi is chargeable beyond 30",4
We visited the hotel a week back during the first week of July 2015 for a company offsite. The sales manager Atishay Jain was very prompt and cooperative and helped us fetch a great package for 60 members.  The property is excellent and at par with other ITC chattels. The hotel is at very prime location right on the mall which added on to our convenience.  The rooms are beautifully designed.   The balcony rooms though small offer a great view of the valley. The front office staff was very courteous and friendly. The breakfast and dinner buffet was elaborate and great. The banquet facility was great and we had a nicely arranged DJ party during the stay.  On a whole we had a fabulous time at the place. As Musoorie has less of places to see around it is all the more vital to have a,4
"I am a big fan of the Oberoi group and was looking forward to our 1 night stay at Trident Gurgaon. We were 5 couples who were booked by one business house from Delhi who does regular business with the hotel. We did get preferential corporate rate but it was disappointing that all 5 rooms were spread apart. Given that the property is spread out, it was inconvenient for us to get together often. The biggest drawback I felt was there is open ground between the reception area ( also where the restaurant and bar is) and the walkway to the rooms. During day time and specially during summer it is very uncomfortable to walk in bright sun especially when you are moving from one airconditioned area to another. The health club and restaurant is nice and the staff is very friendly.",3
"Extremely convenient and comfortable!  The service is top in class.  Amenities and restaurants very clean with an extremely courteous staff. Internet not complementary at your first visit but becomes complementary later on if you sign up for their ""privilege card"".  Do not miss Agra for a week-end visit...  It is just a few hours away.",5
"The Trident Hotel truly is amazing. This will be my 16th time I‚Äôve stayed here and this time is as good as the first time. From the greeting when you arrive to the checkout when you leave and everything in between is something special.   Each and every staff member has an attention to detail second to none. From the chef to the young man who zaps the flies. The food is impeccable, the rooms are large and light with nothing out of place. All of the staff are friendly and never allow you to pass without saying ‚ÄúGood Morning/Good Afternoon‚Äù.  If time permits, I would highly recommend using the spa which I use at least twice during my stay. You wont get a better massage anywhere else in the world!  The Trident Group also have a rewards point system which is very generous and can be",5
It was an awesome experience for us as a family ... Great place to stay ... Awesome breakfast ... Very friendly staff. The rooms are really nice. Their rental cars with chauffeur service is the best.

You can close your eyes and select this property  Pros - Just at the entrance of Gurgaon - Near Udhyog Vihar - Very Silent Property - Very Courteous Staff - Personalized Attention  - Complimentary transfer to Ambiance Mall in Audi  Cons - None,5
"From the moment one enters though the not so typical entry to a hotel and walk through the large open spaces with the elaborate water body, there's a feeling of grandeur and space which is something unique to a city hotel. The lobby area is reached through impressive giant wooden doors. The lobby is big and spacious and leads to the various different areas of the hotel. The rooms are all arranged around the elegant and beautiful pool & spa area in the centre which is the best part of this hotel. The spa packages are great and the service standards at par with the finest in the world. The pool is a great place to relax and enjoy the mesmerising sound of the water falling all around the walls.",5
"After quite some travelling I came across a hotel which actually stands its name. The entry itself is amazing. Their infinity pools,hotel interiors, restaurants everything is classy. Rooms are spacious and interiors have been worked upon tastefully. Sleep quality was excellent. Main thing the centralized AC worked as per the temperatures you set :) The staff was extremely courteous and respectful. You couldn't find a single staff being rude. High five to their service. The breakfast spread was similar to other hotels, but the quality was excellent and the food was amazing. They have concentrated on the Indian menu equally which sadly is sidelined in many other hotels. This one I m definitely booking for all my future Delhi trips :)",5
It is one of the best hotels in the town.Service is gud and you have much to do when you are out there.Dont miss the Gucci show room out there.Rooms are great.you have many options depends upon you what you opt for.For me the experience was un forgtable,4
"Whilst not suggesting that Gurgaon is top of most people's holiday hit lists, I would come here on holiday.  The staff are fantastic, very attentive without interfering, there is a great and large pool, spa and gym.  3 restaurants and bars. This is a business hotel for mainly British guests (as far as I can see).  The hotel can do anything that you need them to do for you from Day Trips to the Taj (Barter) to posting cards for you. My only gripe is that the free wifi is turned off at 9pm.  You can pay ¬£10 for more. You get a free 30 mins a day and free wifi in the pool par until 9pm.",5
"Stayed here while sightseeing in Delhi. Service at this hotel is excellent and on par with international standards. I would say this is aesthetically the nicest Trident (I've stayed at quite a few of their hotels across India) with Thai and Moroccan architectural influence. If there's one word I can use to describe this hotel, it is grand.   I checked in on my birthday and was surprised with a birthday cake in my free-of-charge upgraded room. We had Japanese dinner @Konomi restaurant and the quality along with the service is top notch.   Recommended for people who are doing some sightseeing in Delhi since 1) it is pretty near (20 minutes) from Indira Gandhi International Airport and 2) it feels GREAT to come back to wind down in a cosy hotel after visiting the",5
"I went for work but really enjoyed staying here. The staff is really friendly, the food good, the pool and gym really nice. Hard to say anything bad about this place.  Wish all hotels can be like this...",5
One of the best hotel layouts I have seems - horizontal hotel which means well spread out. Great for business stays for meetings in Gurgaon - away from the crowded commercial areas while at the same time relatively close to everywhere - allows one to switch off for a while. Don't forgot to try the chocolate cookie served complimentary with coffee. Only crib (just inventing one) - need to walk a lot to get to the room due to the size of the hotel!,4
"Stayed there with my family and friends for 2-3 days ... what a hotel ... loved the swimming pool , the rooms the lobby and the entrance to the hotel if you see in night .... you cant forget it .... keep up the good work ... also go there very often for a breakfast or dinner ....",5
"This is easily one of the best hotels,not only in Gurgaon,but in the national capital region. It's a huge property,with massive galleries,restaurants and rooms,giving it the ambiance of  very well spread out palace.It is indeed very aesthetically designed.The security is another strong point of this hotel,it has highly trained and professional men and women designated for security and search operations. Restaurants serve authentic and fresh,wide variety food items,prepared by master chefs and served with great care and courtesy.I was amazed to find on at least two ocassions that the chef and the stewards remembered my personal choices and favorites even when I visited them after a lapse of few months! Great value for money,I prefer to stay here rather than Delhi,because it is",5

"Stayed for one week on business. Extremely comfortable, impeccable service, great food, luxurious design.   The room was spacious and clean. I never exactly figured out the AC so fluctuated between a bit too warm and a bit too cold, but it was no big deal.   Location was good for my business but you'll need hotel car/cab/tuk tuk to get most places. The hotel quickly arranges their car but I normally just went outside the property and got transport for myself. No problems.   Buffet breakfast and lunches were excellent. Dinner in the bar was good.   Fantastic place.",5
"Normally one seldom stays in a Hotel in a city one lives in.I stayed here with my wife as a getaway from home. The Trident Group in general but this hotel in particular is simply spectacular both for business and leisure.An outstanding Executive Chef, a knowledgeable Sommelier and a perfectionist food and beverage manager made my business meetings and getaway a sheer delight.",5
"Truly an amazing experience, customer service was exceptional, hotel layout, views  and ambiance simply something you must experience.  An oasis within bustling Gurgaon. An experience I will never forget",5
We visited the restaurant of the hotel with a group of business associates and had a very pleasant evening with great service an excellent food. We ordered a menu of different dishes and thus tried a large variety of things which were just great! During the next stay in gurgaon I might even want to try the hotel. ,5
This is the sister property to the Oberoi Gurgaon and was built before the Oberoi Gurgaon. In fact you can go between the two hotels.  The Trident is much smaller and more boutiquey.  I have been here multiple times and each time it feels like home.  The service staff is top notch as well as the food in all the restaurants.  They have a great little gym as well as a pool. Arrive at night and you will be in awe of the amazing fire pool at the entrance.,5
"We stayed here for a day before a late evening flight so all we did was lunch and nap but it was a very nice business type hotel. Beware the room numbering system! It was super confusing and we ended up wandering the halls for twenty frustrating minutes. If a staff member offers to walk you to your room take them up on it. The lunch buffet was outstanding--and this was after two weeks in India, so I was jaded and sick of buffets. Don't bother making the trek to the adjacent hotel to check out their shops. It was a convoluted journey and they were all very high end designer type places rather than fun Indian places.",4
Went for lunch at trident .... super property ... makes you feel totally out of delhi with large dome shaped architect .... buffet was decent ... wouldnt say the best but quite nice ... only if they can get more varieties for vegetarians would be better ... super interiors .... will probably stay here next time ...,5
"I stayed in Gurgaon a couple weeks in January for work, and very much enjoyed my stay at Trident. To be honest, luxury hotels in India are amazing, but this is probably the nicest Trident hotel (btw, Oberoi which is the next building is even more luxurious than Trident for information, but I have never stayed there...).  The hotel itself looks like a palace, I have never been a big fan of Trident rooms as they are somewhat generic in my opinion (not too much character), but I admit they are very nice still! The staff is extremely polite, nice and helpful, always trying to make your stay better. The gym is big enough, there is an outdoor pool (but with the cold temperature I didn't feel like swimming...) and the food is also pretty good (one of the chefs at the multi-cuisine",5

"A wonderful home away from home.  in spite of our 2a.m. arrival the staff were ready to great us, courteous as possible.  The entire trip was wonderful, made so much better by this resort.  The people, the room, the bar and restaurant.  My impression of India is forever wonderful based on the Trident.  I look forward to visiting other Trident resorts.",5
"We traveled to India for a week of combined business/pleasure.  We were picked up at the Airport in Delhi by a driver in a Mercedes Benz.  After fighting traffic (it's always bad in the Delhi area!) we were brought to the hotel in Gurgaon.  What an oasis!  We drove up to the portico, where we were greeted by the staff and our bags were put through security.  Security is tight at the hotel, and all guests walk through a metal detector.  We walked up to the hotel, past the fire dancing on the reflecting pool.  The front end staff were incredibly gracious, as was the entire staff.  In the week we stayed there, not one person was anything less than friendly, warm, and hospitable.   Our room was upgraded (my husband stays there about once per year for business) to a junior suite.

"I stayed at the Trident Hotel in Gurgaon - checked in 16 April / Checked Out 18 April, and it was an awesome experience. It reconfirmed my faith that the Oberoi / Trident Group just pull out all stops, when it comes to giving their guests the best time ever - right from the airport representative, to the person who finally drops you back to the airport, everyone is just so friendly, extremely polite, ever willing to assist and help in any way possible.. one never had to ask for anything - it was just there... the attention to detail was pleasing...the courtyard ambience was just great, and it looked very nice in the evenings with the candles and the fire torches - it gave one a feeling of being in the desert, with the pool seeming like an oasis !   Couple of things that could",5
"This hotel is lovely, the entrance is very grand and white.  The decor is very modern, and in some ways the hotel felt more of a business hotel than a tourist venue.  Meals were buffet style and the staff were very attentive.  There seemed to be a member of staff on hand for everything.  Every door was opened for you with a smile and they always smiled and acknowledged clients when passing in the corridors etc.  Rooms were well equipped and generous in size with a desk for business people.  A gorgeous infinity pool feature leads down some steps to the swimming area which appeared very inviting, and the lights at night were really pretty.  The location is not great, being in a business district, and there is nowhere to ""walk to"" if you leave the hotel grounds.  Ideal as a short",5
Trident Gurgoan is a luxury resort in Gurgaon adjoining NH 8 very near to New Delhi airport. I booked my stay encashing my Trident Privilege points and was upgraded to a top notch suite. Food is of high quality and I enjoyed my stay to the fullest. Like all other Oberoi properties staff is very well groomed. Spa here is highly recommended.,5
"Landed in Delhi day before and was blown away by luxurious surprise Trident gave. Got picked up from airport, escorted by a hotel staff, chauffeur driven Merc. Was booked in a executive garden facing room but got upgraded to Presidential suite. Fabulous rooms, Fabulous staff - Nitin at front desk, duty manager, housekeeping.  Fabulous service. Thank you. ",5
"The Trident is an absolute oasis in the otherwise challenging city of Delhi - a fascinating city full of great people but nevertheless a challenge. To be able to return to this level of comfort and luxury at the end of a day's site-seeing is a pleasure I would not wish to forego. The bedrooms are spacious, spotless and very well appointed. The dining is top quality through-out. The layout and decor is unsurpassed from the wide, uncluttered courtyards to the magnificent sunken pool area and entry reflection pool aflame each night. I probably sound like a commercial but I could not fault it and the staff were fantastic.",5
"Akanksha Lamba is a master hotelier .She tracks her service and responds with world class efficiency , courtesy and hospitality . She wouldn't be out of place at The Oriental . The boulangerie is another matter ! Repeatedly the bread at breakfast was not baked the same morning .Trident has only one kind of croissant and it was soggy and limp.Hotels as average as Taj Vivanta and Pullman do better croissant and greater variety . The baker doesn't know what a baguette is . Chef Randeep Kwatra at Pullman (now Meridien) makes the best in town. On 9th the fried egg was leathery .Of course it was changed as soon as we complained.On 10th it was perfect .The lamb chops were exceptional and so was the grilled salmon .Service was exceptional throughout. Excellent coffee is served through",4
"Beautiful and excellent hotel, restaurants, pool, spa, etc.  Location is just outside of Delhi, not far from airport and a quiet, calming environment with fine architecture, well maintained.  Rooms are beautiful and spacious, staff is responsive in every way, food at breakfast and dinner is high quality, authentic and diverse Indian.  Easy access to Delhi, but an oasis.  Stay here.",5
"While not actually at the airport, this hotel is close enough to serve as a very good refuge for anyone looking for an extremely comfortable spot between flights or before an early morning flight. The architecture is modern and attractive. The accommodations provide everything that a traveller could want - good wifi, a pleasant bar, outstanding shops, and  a restaurant prepared to respond to tired travelers looking for a variety of food at different times of the day.",4
"Gorgeous clean, spacious rooms. Comfortable beds. Loads of TV channels to choose from. Big bathroom. Very quiet and relaxing hotel to stay in. Considering it's just off the main road you'd thinking would be noisy, but the design makes it an oasis of tranquility to escape the noisy streets.  Lovely food. Breakfast was so vast. Buffett dinner also offered loads of choice to cater for all tastes.  Staff really make the place. So helpful and thoughtful. Always smiling and polite. Rush to help carry your bags.  Really high safety standards. Thorough security checks.  Gym and pool facility's both wonderful.  Cannot recommend highly enough.........................",5
"From the moment you step onto the property you are amazed.  The property is stunning.  This was the third time I stayed at the hotel and cannot find a single complaint.  The hotel is situated about 15 minutes from Delhi airport.  5 minutes from Gurgaon business district.  Driver from airport was attentive and the merc was very comfortable.  It's not in the heart of delhi.  The rooms are absolutely amazing if you get a pool view.  5 star quality and finishing.  The common areas are stunning.  Built like a palace.  Breakfasts are unbelievable.  You will not be disappointed.  Indian restaurant is also super impressive.  Local live musicians play in the background boosting the atmosphere.  There is a small gift arcade, which for Indian standards is expensive, however has a lot of",5
"Trident Gurgaon is  a beautiful hotel. The landscape is simply amazing. This is more  like a resort. Our stay was so well taken care of. As always, the staff was super efficient. The restaurants are good.   I am falling short of words to express how  beautiful this hotel is. Strongly recommend to experience this once and you will get addicted to this  property for sure.",5
"Since my flight left late, I checked into this hotel for about 6 hrs before my late flight.  This hotel is quite nice, located about 15 minutes to the international airport in New Delhi.  I ordered room service (excellent paneer that I can't stop thinking about!)  Service in general was quite accommodating.  The staff seemed eager to hear about my trip to their wonderful country and explain the things this hotel had to offer.  Unfortunately, I had such a limited time I didn't get to take advantage of the amenities.  There is a mall across the street from the hotel.  You cannot walk to it because of a busy highway (which, by the way is not visible from the property.  The grounds of this hotel are very lush and are like an oasis in the center of town.  I also didn't hear any",5
"Great property... great service. Very comfortable stay!!  Trident, Gurgaon is one of the best business hotels I have stayed in... The service is quite efficient, cleanliness is great and most important, it has amazing food.",5
"The public areas of this hotel are nothing short of palatial! High ceilings and enormous almost ceiling height doors are very impressive.  The staff were very attentive and helpful, particularly in the restaurant , where staff explained dishes and also personally tailored dishes to suit patrons tastes . The room was beautiful with a view of a shallow peacock blue pool which came right up to the window.",5
"Beautiful layout with impressive walkways to the reception, courtyards, and rooms.  Clever use of the pool in the middle to create tranquility.  It is a world of difference between what lies inside the walls of this hotel compound and the outside.  Staffs are helpful and friendly.  However, service could be a little bit more prompt. And an additional treadmill machine during the morning peak hours would be ideal.",4
"I stay here regularly and i do simply because every stay is excellent. From the quality of the pool room with its super comfortable bed and bedding, to the quality of the food and the service provided i look forward to everyone of my visits.  Despite the many other hotels i stay at in India, often at 2 or 3 times the cost of my stay here this is still me preferred destination when i am in Gurgaon or Delhi.",5
This is a lovely oasis I'm Gurgaon. The rooms are large and very clean. The staff are wonderful and very helpful. The beds and pillows are comfy. The bathroom I well appointed with amenities. The pool is gorgeous and warm.,5
"Ultra modern luxury hotel but another Trident hotel with ridiculously expensive drinks and no free wi-fi. Unlike other hotels in the Group they have no happy hour(!!) but do have a business suite where for a nominal charge you can print flight boarding cards etc. It's well located for the airport, the reason we spent a night at it. The hotel is very spacious ,has high ceilings and domes with furniture to match, long corridors and outside is landscaped mainly with stone and dark blue water. It's a bit impersonal and has a softer ambience at night when lights are on. Service is very good (didn't have to open a door myself) and everyone is smiling. The restaurant was good with a great dinner buffet although disappointed that pasta etc at the fresh cooking areas were charged extra.",4
"During the first stay in 2014, myself and a colleague found that there was a lack of communication between the Reception Desk and the Hotel Car Service, which complicated our journeys to and from the office. We were very transparent with our views and to my very pleasant surprise, out views were taking into consideration and rectified - there was a flawless Hotel Car service. Ideal place for women travelling alone.",5
The Trident Gurgaon is amazing. The is hotel spotless. The staff beyond helpful and supportive. It is truly a 5 star hotel. My only down thought is its a bit sedate. It could be a bit more fun in the Lounge and around the pool. That said its a relaxing oasis not a party hotel. It is one of the best Hotel staffs and best service I have received anywhere in the world! ,5
"We had our companies research meet over here for a weekend. The stay had to be excellent as expected from a 5 star hotel. What makes it stand apart is the initial long stretch once you enter the gate and reach the reception area. The place looks amazing under lights. The service was excellent. And surprisingly the food was fantastic, not one of the usual characteristics of a 5 star hotel. It's definitely a perfect place to stay in case you are planning to go to Gurgaon for a weekend or so.",5
"The hotel is on its way towards achieving some excellence awards in coming years. It is a huge land (over seven acres) with over 150+ rooms. Overspacious place. Once you are inside you feel yourself in an entirely different world, away from the day to day chaotic life outside.",4
"A True Luxury Hotel, just a KM out of Delhi-Gurgaon Border, very convenient for Airport & if you happen to have work in Gurgaon, Manesar, Bawal...great choice. You get a feeling of palace Nice Rooms , with Garden or Pool View. Friendly Staff, good conference rooms & good choice of meals at various Restaurants,.",5
"I stayed here for two nights whilst on business. I arrived at an unearthly hour due to my delayed flight, but the staff were expecting me and greeted me by name on arrival, taking me to my room to complete the check in. It couldn't have been more relaxed. My room was a good size, with a lovely bathroom. It was handy for the airport, but still very quiet. I ate at the adjoining Oberoi seafood restaurant one night, which was fantastic. Great place, I felt really looked after.",5
"My husband and I spent 3 days at the Trident after a two week tour of India.  The hotel itself is lovely and the service excellent.  But the staff there takes  attentive service to the next level.  I love to eat Indian food and especially enjoy south Indian breakfast.  The staff at the hotel not only served excellent Indian food, they gave me Indian cookbooks and their own Indian spices.  I am particularly enjoying  their Sambar recipe with their own Sambar spices.  I look forward to my next  visit to India and a stay at theTrident!",5
"I stayed at the Trident Gurgaon for the month of February on business. The location was close to the office and very convenient. Check in was easy, they greeted me upon arrival and walked me to my room.  The hotel is very well maintained and clean, from the grounds and pools to the rooms. I had sent an inquiry to the hotel before my arrival and received a satisfactory answer. What I didn't expect was for Balika from housekeeping to check in after my arrival to ensure everything was fine. This was the start of the impeccable service this hotel provides.  My room was a good size and the housekeeping staff was excellent. Housekeeping greeted me when possible and always asked if there was anything more I wanted or needed in my room. The room overlooked water and trees and was a",5
"Our favourite Delhi hotel to date (we also preferred it to the Lodhi and to Agra‚Äôs Trident). Luxurious, modern, spotless with a lively but refined atmosphere.   Our poolside room was on the small side, but had all the amenities we needed. Staff were all helpful and smiley. The lobby is dramatic as is the hotel‚Äôs entrance (the river lapwing pottering along the water‚Äôs edge when we arrived was a bonus!), wifi worked well and the complementary car and driver to the nearby Ambience Mall a plus.   We didn‚Äôt eat or use the hotel amenities other than the room and bar as we stayed an all too short evening ahead of our very early morning flight home, but the bar served good Sula wines and nibbles; the sunken pool and spa looked lovely (and dramatic at night with their flaming torches);",5
"Let's admit.  Both my husband and I were very tired then.  We needed to get out of daily life and get the peace of mind back.  We stayed 2 nights in October 2014 over the long weekend.  It was JUST perfect.  When we arrived, we wondered if we had chosen a right hotel - as it was just off highway.  Once inside we were caught by the surprise of not hearing any traffic.  The pool was very quiet.  Probably more for adult-way of enjoying than kids' play. (But you can take your kids to the mall nearby.)  The restaurants were good.  The service met the expectation.",5
"Good Facility. We had a session for business meeting at one of there conference room. Very good Hospitality.Good Food with wide spread at Cilantro, the restaurant.  Although the rooms provided to some guest were twin bed for single occupancy was not up to the mark.",5
"There is nothing wrong with the hotel itself... It s a nice property and there probably arent very many that are done this well in Gurgaon or Delhi....  However, what kills it is the poor attitude of the staff... Booked a 01 night stay with them since we were working very late and did not want to drive back home without rest... Booking said King size bed and what i got was split beds without even a heads up at the reception. The phones in the room did not work.... I had to use the one in the washroom to call the reception to change my room. All of this when the hotel knew i was staying with them after a 36 hr work day.... very ppor attitude of the people that attended my calls... was on hold for almost 2-3 mins and was passed on to different extensions....   Dont recommend the",1
"We booked a pick up from the airport, was perfectly organized and executed. Upon arrival there is already a welcome committee waiting for you, traditionally dressed. Usual safety check. The check in process went very smooth and you are accompanied to your room. The layout of the hotel is very smart. The hotel is located next to a very busy highway, including the noise level that comes with it, if you every were travelling by car in India you know what I mean :). The rooms are located on a lower level so you do not hear anything off all the noise around - though it does mean you have to walk a bit but it is worth it. The rooms are quite luxurious - have everything you need in it and are nicely decorated (maybe a bit too overdone for my taste), nice view to the garden. Everything",4
"As you walk into the hotel at night, you are struck by its desert style architecture, it's lattice patterns and the water pool with burning ""mashal"". A very tall glass door takes you into the lobby, efficient service and then you get to your room. Don't miss the black and white floor pattern in the middle of pristine marble.   You realise the hotel conveys ""height"". High and tall doors, narrow corridors with high ceiling, high room ceilings, high glass windows, high back chairs, etc. If you have inner view, you have water beds or the pool to see. Or you see manicured lawns. As a business hotel, possibly one of the best in India - beaten only by Trident Hyderabad. The beds are very comfortable, wi-fi is great. Room service and restaurant options are fantastic. Great conference",5
"Absolutely love the Trident Gurgaon.  Feels more like a luxury leisure hotel than a business hotel. Beautiful landscaping, water bodies and lobby.  Restaurants serve great food and provide amazing service. part of the Oberoi group and well priced for a 5* hotel!",5
If you are looking for real luxury Royal style then this is the place to be while in Gurgaon. Everything is really exquisite as is expected from a top 5 star brand in the country. The swimming pool is a real gem. So carry your swimming trunks when you are there.,5
"THE best business hotel in Gurgaon. Amidst the surrounding chaos, the hotel gives the serene atmosphere.. not a typical modern structure. the laid back, palace like structure gives one a nice break from the city. very good service as well.",5
"We stayed here for 2 nights to relax after a very busy & tiring 2 1/2 week tour of India and this was certainly a good choice.  The hotel is elegant  and the rooms are well appointed, comfortable, spotless.  We had 2 great nights of sleep here.  All of the staff provided excellent service; almost over the top for our tastes.  My husband had injured his back and they provided us with a wheelchair which I don't think I ever pushed myself more that a few feet.  Even if we were leaving our room it seemed a staff member always appeared & stopped what they were doing  to take us to the lobby.  They provided us with transport to the airport and they had an airport wheelchair already arranged for us and escorted us as far as they could into the airport.  All of this was very much",5
"The Trident Gurgaon is a superbly designed single level hotel, well spread out over a few acres of land and yet located in the heart of the bustling business hub of Gurgaon.  The hotel is a short distance from Delhi Airport and offers a quality airport transfer service for guests arriving by aeroplane. The cars used are Audi A6 vehicles.  The rooms are clean and comfortable however the couch and coffee table area in the room is rather cramped.  The breakfast buffet and dinner buffet at Cilantro restaurant is highly recommended and I was impressed by the taste and quality of the food options offered at the restaurant. I highly recommend the pizza at Cilantro.  We were quite happy with the level of customer services offered by the staff at the Trident Gurgaon. I would like to",5
"Stayed here the last night of a 2-week holiday - booked from the UK by the tour operator - also booked as convenient for the airport.  A very stylish & chic modern hotel; rooms are very nice & clean. We had a room at the far end away from reception so was very quiet. Staff as ever in these large Indian hotels are great - well-trained & friendly. Ate in the evening in the Indian restaurant - great meal - chef came out & checked up so had a good chat with him (traditional music also included). Breakfast was also very good.  This was only a way-stop for us before flying home - its convenient for India Gandhi Airport - but certainly worth a visit. Suffers slightly though rom the new elevated road only a few hundred yards away - lots of background noise outside, peaceful inside",5
"Excellent service, with over friendly staff. The comfortable room and tasty food (but expensive) will relax you after a working day. Heaven in overjammed Gurgaon. Much better than Leila Gurgaon. I went to both. Expensive but worth it. Bad points? Internet not included and too much staff sometimes. Definitively you should go for it. What else ?",5
Property is extremely well-maintained. Airport is also not far away. Like any other Trident property there is no question on the service front. But the buffet in the Indian restaurant wasn't upto the mark at all.,4
"I have had the most amazing experience in this hotel. Attention to detail is second to none: staff, decor, architecture, housekeeping, service...even amenities of all kind work flawlessly. From the check in experience to all the gestures the staff has with you, I would say it is really a great deal for the money. Definitely recommended.",5
"I had stayed here earlier for a business trip as well. But I planned the start of my honeymoon here and it was fabulous. Everything from the beginning to the end is perfect, service, food and the ambience. The hotel will gladly connect you to the rapid metro, you can change lines go to Delhi  tour the city and come back in full safety. Avoid the Gurgaon local transportation, use the hotel drop to the nearest Rapid Metro and come back safely.   There is nothing to see at Gurgaon except the microbreweries and Kingdom of Dreams, but Delhi is full of great eateries and sites. Take the Metro in the off peak hours and experience a different Delhi and Gurgaon.   Trident is one the best experiences I have had in hospitality nationally.",5
"This is a wonderful hotel. The architecture is very elegant, and creates a wonderful feeling of tranquility. As soon as you enter the gates and leave behind the craziness of Delhi/Gurgaon, your are dipped into tranquility. As other reviewers have said, you are treated like royalty. The check-in process is totally stress free, all staff make every effort to serve your every need - and all with a smile. I used the bar, the Inidan Restaurant and the main restaurant, and in every case the food was excellent. Rooms are spacious, elegantly appointed, well air conditioned, and very quiet. At night time the place looks wonderful, especially around the pool area - beautifully lit. My room was facing the pool, which is certainly a wonderful outlook. The location is perfect for the access",5
"Fabulous like other oberoi hotels...good value for money..close to airport n manufacturing companies nearby Good option for business travel Hesitated earlier to stay as highway constructions etc...but now, its very convenient",4
"The Trident has it all from beautiful grounds to amazing food to wonderful staff. You are treated like royalty and no request is too small. Everyone is friendly and helpful; and will work with you to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I had a blissful experience, and after a long work day, was able to relax in a safe and quiet retreat.",5
"I stayed at hotel Trident in gurgaon few years back and was impressed by the ambience, cleanliness, spacious area. The hotel is also quite and has good facilities.The staff is very friendly and supportive.",4
The rooms are pretty small compared to other five stars maybe thats because the property is quite old. Also the toiletries can be improved it does not include a toothbrush and couple of other things which is  standard in other five stars Rest nothing to complain about. ,3
From first entering this lovely hotel to our departure the staff at this hotel were fantastic in particular the staff in the restaurant. We were sad to leave.The hotel was spotless and every question answered.,5
"The Trident is one of those properties that takes you away.  Upon arrival you are greeted (by name) from the staff, escorted to your room and the setting is a quite calm.  The architecture of the Trident is very different and has an open feeling.  It's almost SPA like.  Restaurants and food has both traditional Indian, Asian and American cuisines.  The only thing about the Trident I did not like is everything I mentioned.  Unless I'm looking for a SPA like experience and want to be away from it all then I would choose to stay here again.  However, when traveling on business I want to be in the mix, have the luxury of walking outside to a nearby restaurant, catch the sites, go to the market to shop and feel like I'm in a very lively setting.  It's an excellent stay, but I felt to",4
"Wonderful place - an outstanding combination of super service, facilities, food, truly resort-like atmosphere... I was on business trip to New Delhi, not a first time, but first time stayed in Trident. To say I was impressed is to say nothing.. All the nights and days what I was there, were truly spectacular. Breakfast was made-to-order and nice, pool and area around the pool was very welcoming.. Hotel is nicely isolated from road noise, even it is very close to main Gurgaon road. My personal preference to stay in Gurgaon area - will come back as soon as possible.  On the development side, I would only mention the SPA - while it does have nice settings and attitude & service are top notch, the actual Balinese massage I had was quite average.. would love to have a more",5
"This hotel is quite simply faultless. From the moment you arrive, staff address you by your name, you are treated exceptionally well and the facilities are great.  Trident has to be the benchmark for hospitality. Simply excellent.  The breakfast, lunch and dinner offering is varied and price/quality is good.  I would highly recommend this hotel. The management team and all the hotel staff are worthy of praise. Wonderful stay.  ",5
"Have stayed here from time to time on work trips. It's quite a standard trident hotel... Well laid out. Good service. Breakfast deserves a special mention as everyone is attentive, they also do takeaway coffees/ tea.  Water bodies are soothing but must be attracting mosquitoes at times I guess.",5
"I stay at the hotel every time i am in Delhi for the past 10 years. The staffs are very friendly and helpful and even their driver would try out the best to help. I particularly like their house-keeping service which helps change a better support mattress for my spinal problem.  The food tastes good too but a bit pricey. Overall, it is an excellent hotel to stay for vacation and business.",5
"I live in New Delhi and went for weekend to this Hotel, hardly 30 mins drive from my home, to have a relaxing time with my wife and a couple friend. We were assured during check-in for a great service which we were expecting from Oberoi's property too, but to our shock the services delivered went disastrous from day one to the time we checked out. First night we ordered diner at 11.30pm and were served at 2.30 am after it was changed thrice due to bad quality, to our surprise same thing happened in morning with in-room breakfast when we were served finally at 1 pm after repeated mistakes and change of cold food. the last day when we had to check-out, me and my wife were woken up due to some cleaning work going on above our room which was annoying as we could not sleep again and",1
"Have been staying here for last few days, and the service is impeccable - I don't think they know how to say 'No'!! 24 hour gym, hot water swimming pool, very personalised service, am looking forward to staying remaining two weeks with them.",5
Stayed at the hotel twice and each time had a truly out of the world experience which the Oberoi's are famous for. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean. The gym was a bit far but had a refreshing lime water to make the work out more fun. The water bodies are a treat to the eyes.,5
Great hotel wonderful staff modern architecture  We only had a one day stay but because of our outbound flight being at 9pm they made accommodations to help us not be orphans.   Great food in the Cilantro restaurant both for dinner and breakfast.  A special notice to Chef Divesh who created a dish for my wife with the ingredients that she had chosen. He even took his time to explain to us exactly how some Indian dishes are prepared.   The entire staff were helpful attentive and always smiling ,5
We stayed at The Trident Gurgaon in perhaps the busiest week in New Delhi.  Although the hotel was working at full capacity - the services and the attention to the smallest detail were immaculately maintained. From the porters to the front desk staff - each person we encountered was full of smiles  and immensely helpful - sorting out problems or issues with extreme professional courtesy.  The ambience of the hotel is superb - understated yet classy.  The food served at the Saffron and Celantro were delicious and filling. Will definitely be returning - over & over again.,5
"Recently we had a lovely weekend at this hotel. We arrived late in the eveining and the sight at the entrance is stunning with fire burning in the middle of water body, a beautiful sky overhead and lush green lawns on all sides. The warm Trident welcome and superbly done up interiors. the floors are shining so much that you dont need a mirror, cleanliness is par excellence. Everyone on the team Trident is warm, courteous and smiling to make each moment special. We were fed with such care and love with amazing taste and quality.  We would thank personally, at the door Ranjeet, Kuldeep,Mohit. In the restaurant Pankaj, Abhijeet, Mehal, Ashu, Nilakshi and Saudamini- for cooking the custom made meals for us. At the pool were Ashish and Sanjay. And in housekeeping was Shadab. ( Many",5
"I stayed in Trident for the second time and thought it would be worth providing a review about them. Hotel ambience is classy. It is worth the money you spend. Hotel staff is friendly and as a matter of fact a bit too friendly, yeah, sometimes one would just want to be left alone, but over here, the staff is a bit over zealous about it to the point of being intrusive, but  I would give it them because their intent is to make the guests as comfortable as they possibly can.",5
"We checked in at 7pm after a short flight from Udaipur for a one night stay before heading home to the UK. What an incredible place !  It is an oasis in a very busy suburb of Delhi. Everything about the hotel was perfect - the room, the bathroom, the bar, the floodlit pools outside. Sadly we didn't get to eat in one of the restaurant as were meeting friends but they looked exceptional. The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. We would recommend and return without hesitation should we return to Delhi.",5
"My second visit this January and is just amazing. The service is outstanding, attention to detail incredible and the balinese massage is out of this world! Not really a family hotel (although i did see some families there), it's more a business/adults hotel where you can escape the chaos of Gurgaon. ",5
"The Trident Gurgaon is Opulent, Contemporary & Convenient. Located just near the Gurgaon Toll Gate (which is now no longer a toll gate though), its perfect for those looking for a hotel close to the airport in Gurgaon.   It's a dream 5 star hotel. You forget you are in the middle of a bustling city. The Hotel Entrance  is quite underwhelming until you reach the promenade which is then completely over-the-top. I was awestruck when I entered the Reception area. It really redefines the expectations one has of space from a city hotel. It doesn't feel like one at all & you end up feeling you're in a luxurious resort on some exotic island.  The rooms are brilliant. It's all & more that one could ask for in a top of the line 5 star. The Service is fantastic, the food is good (excellent",5
"A beautifully-appointed hotel with spacious rooms but a little soulless, designed for the business traveller.  We could have been anywhere in the world.  The food in the restaurant was divine but ludicrously expensive.",4
Stayed here for 2 nights.    Beautiful spacious rooms with fresh linen.  Both restaurants are wonderful.  The staff in Cilantro Restaurant were charming.  Nothing is too much trouble.  The food was divine. We didn't see much of the grounds as Delhi was in the grips of dense fog and 5 deg temperature but what we could glance through the gloom was lovely.,5
We spend one night in this luxury hotel. Excellent staff and atmosphere. The Cilandro restaurant was probably the best we had during one week five-star journey across Rajasthan and Dheli. Absolutely high quality of food and enjoyment for stomach. Western travelers could be distracted by hyper active waiting servicemen - trying to sneak your plate as soon as possible. The worst part - extremely expensive Wi-Fi in the area full of business people.,5
"Best service ever!! Everything was really great. Food was very good, rooms were very clean. Stayed there for 6 nights and couldn't complain about anything. Also the whole location is amazing, especially at night when a lot of torches are lighted.",5
"Stayed here for around 12 nights over three different stays in December - long enough to experience everything that is good and bad about the place.   The property itself (public areas and outdoors) is magnificent, quiet and serene, and it's easy to forget one is in Gurgaon (always a good thing!). The Superior double rooms however are fairly tiny and dank. We happened to stay in one of the Deluxe rooms for one of the stays and the difference in size, ambience and general pleasantness is massive. Overall, we felt that the Superior doubles are not worth the price and it's worth shelling out that much extra for the Deluxe rooms to get better value for your money. Also, avoid the Garden facing rooms - there is a distinct lack of privacy in these rooms with random people and staff",4
Stayed in this excellent hotel during a business trip. The hotel setting is breath taking. Beautiful pool. Breakfast en diners were great while staff are helpfull and attentive. Rooms are spacious and free wifi is available.,5
Inside the heart of Gurgaon is this beautiful property which can be good for both holiday and business. The staff is extemely courteous and helpful. The food is awesome at all times and the property is very exotic and serene. Had a very good time and would life to come again ,4
"This is easily one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  The level of service here is excellent (Indians take the hotel business very seriously) and the ambiance and d√©cor of the place is something else.  We stayed in 3 different rooms over two stays (try and get one where the water comes right up to the window) and they were all spotless and quiet.  The extra good points were: (1) there is a 30M rectangular pool, which is heated to about 28C, even in the winter - it is an outdoor pool, but who cares when its heated! I used it in December, no problems.  The gym staff are outstanding too (2) the gym is excellent - it is not a ""lifter's"" gym in terms of holding big weights - but the equipment is good stuff (Gymtech) and it is spotless and open 24 hours (3) room service was",5
"When I arrived at the Trident Hotel after a long journey from the US, I realized that my wallet was gone! The staff at the hotel went out of their way to help me. Very clean, beautiful and comfortable",5
"My wife and I are currently enjoying the second of our two nights at the Trident Gurgaon. We have been fortunate enough to stay at many fine hotels around the world, including the likes of Claridges in London, but we think that this hotel is one of the very best we have ever experienced. The surroundings, rooms, fittings etc are all superb, but most of all it is the staff who make the place. Nothing is ever too much trouble and everything they do is done with pleasure and a smile. Not once has a staff member failed to stop and say hello when walking past, even going to the extent of putting down their mobile phone to greet you, even when only passing in the corridor. They treat you with immense respect and care, but always with a warmth and a smile that is often lacking, even in",5
"This Trident property is located in Gurgaon; as far as I could understand it is close to industrial area & you don't have anything for recreation just next Hotel. Although you may have access to Gurgaon malls with 15-20 minutes of drive. The property is very grand & classy, not sure if you would really want to step out. It gives the feel of resort in Dubai & not of any business property.However it has all the amenities that you may want in business property.  The moment you enter you get a glimpse of the reflective pool.  Try to get pool view rooms; although I could not get one. Even Garden view was very pleasant & relaxing.   Spacious & peaceful rooms.Very comfortable bed, good Bath area with a small closet in room kind of space to store your luggage  The restaurant have good",5
"This was an absolutely amazing hotel and staff were better than any I have ever seen! Not only were they friendly and always smiling, they were quick to act on situations. My wife stated to feel light headed in the restaurant (nothing against the food, we had only just arrived from Australia so she was just over tired) and the staff were all over her and making sure she was fine, bringing her special drinks to rehydrate her and just checking up on her. Just amazing.  There were a lot of lurks things that made this place extra special, the fact that everybody seemed to remember and know or names, that the water from the tap is filleted and that they just constantly go that extra step. Would not hesitate in recommending!",5
"Visiting Delhi for a business meeting. This hotel is near everything you need. The rooms are beautiful and the service is great. I would recommend this hotel . Taxis are close by. Be aware as anyone visiting India, it's always busy busy and traffic will always be bad. However you don't hear the noise from within the hotel. ",4
"So typical of all Trident properties, the Trident Gurgaon was a sight to look at. We had a offcial meeting and used their conference room facilities. Great service, lovely food at Cilantro. Perfect for a day visit. Am sure their rooms would be equally lovely.....",5
"i've stayed in numerous top hotels in Delhi and keep coming back to the Trident Gurgaon (first stayed here when it was the Trident Hilton back in 2006/7).  great welcome, beautiful grounds, fab breakfast and awesome pool.  the addition of the oberoi next door just adds to the choice in not only F&B but also pool & gym too (though i didnt use the Oberoi this time).  the rooms are a little dated but no complaints - even a late pickup from the hotel car service was more than compensated by prompt investigation and apology/offer from the duty manager (they actually record the calls made to the hotel so that made it easy for them to realise that not only is the customer always right in general but in this specific case i was actually right :-)  ).  will definitely return.",5
"I stayed at the Trident on business. It was a large office group for an offsite meeting. Since it was a large office group, it felt more like family outing. And the hotel made it both comfortable and enjoyable. The rooms are good size, large and comfortable. The breakfast was great. It's a beautiful hotel. The swimming pool looks great. The evening ambiance of the hotel is amazing. The reception staff was most helpful. Check in was speedy. The hotel is close to the airport and also close to some of Gurgaon's big shopping malls. We stayed for two nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. I intend to go again for a weekend stay.",5
"Second stay in Gurgaon, first on this hotel (the other, unfortunately, was at the Westin)... from now onwards, it will always be the Trident...   Great Hotel, peaceful ambience, particularly good noise insulation even in open areas. FANTASTIC restaurant. The Indian food Chef (Sandeep if I remember correctly), and the waiters are all good people. Food is very tasty. A bit on the pricy side, but you get top quality... The Gym is simply awesome. And so is breakfast.   Very nice rooms. Very nice architecture in general.   I just look forward to go back. Thanks! Sergio.",5
"The building is very beautiful, with large spaces, very nice fountains with fire in the middle. The service is wonderful, with many kind waiters and always available. Very good breakfast with many kind of food.  The room is perfect: clean, silent and with all what you need.",5
This is one of the best properties i have seen. Staff are very friendly. I like the way that everyone of them wish you with a smile :) Trivial but effective move by hotel management  Food is good. Gym is good. 2 days stay is worth of money :),5
A large hotel with long corridors set around a pool and water features. It seemed souless to me possibly because of size of reception areas etc. Large number of staff who opened doors whenever you went which i found disconcerting. The room was nice enough but poor view which was of the garden but could only see a short length of grass and then what i assume was boundary wall. It seems they do not want guests walking the lawns as they were fenced off. Pleanty of choice at meals and they are preapared to make special orders but you would have to pay more if they did. We were tourists and the hotel is definately more geared to business travellers. I was used to the rounding up to nearest 10 rupees when buying drinks etc but here as if prices were not expensive enough they rounded,3
"This hotel is adjacent to the Oberoi which is a newer and more luxurious hotel (had a first class business lunch at the Oberoi).  While the Trident hotel grounds are appealing, this hotel does not merit 5 stars.  The rooms are on the small side, there is no separate bath from shower and the drain did not work very well.  There are limited choices in the mini-bar.  The gym equipment is ok but certainly not state of the art.  Great location for airport arrivals/departures, of course. Paid wifi - which should be free.",4
"This is an upscale hotel, mainly for business travelers. Facilities and grounds are well maintained (hotel is 11 years old). Fitness center has good selection of equipment. Normally I would prefer staying at the Oberoi but this hotel is a good second choice.",4
I stayed here on business.  This hotel is pure luxury and as impressive in real life as it is in the  pictures. Looks the best at night. Buffet really good plenty of variety to choose from.  The staff are really attentive.   Would definitely go back. ,5
Stayed there an entire week as I had work in Gurgaon - The property is beautiful as you walk through the front entrance and the staff was extremely helpful. There was a small incident that i raised to the management and their corrective action and response was superb. In fact I received multiple emails from the hotel management following up to ensure I was satisfied.,5
"I have been transferred to this hotel after stayed for 3 nights at their sister hotel (The Oberoi) which located side by side. I think my company want me to enjoy my 6 nights stay in India. I got room with very pleasant pool view, looks superb!",5
Stayed for 1 night in the hotel in June 2013 for an office conference. The property is stunning and the view of the swimming pool is stunning. Rooms are magnificent and huge. Staff is extremely hospitable and helpful. Breakfast spread is to die for and food overall tastes amazing. ,5
"The property is just out of the world. The service is really good and it is very well maintained. The breakfast has so many amazing options that you really can't choose what to eat.  The staff takes care of your every need. They also have a loyalty program, which is quite interesting.  The only drawback of this property is steps - they seem to have a lot of steps. Although they have disabled friendly access but just too many steps. It would have been nice if everything is of the same level.",5
As part of my escort tour we were booked in at this hotel for an overnight stay before returning to UK. The hotel setting was breath taking. Very impressive modern design and lovely room facilities. There is free wifi at the poolside bar which is most useful for travellers and also free wifi in the room for nominees. Food was very good and the staff was very attentive and helpful. Highly recommended.,5
"This hotel is incredible.  The service is superb, the thought and care of the staff is superior to any hotel we have stayed in.  The location is convenient for the airport (it took us 15 mins by car) and although outside of Delhi, it takes only 20-30 mins to drive into the city (assume metro is even quicker).  That travelling time is worth it for the service and the setting which I must say took our breath away.  The pool is beautiful and the entrance looks like a Bond villain's lair.  Should we ever visit Delhi again we would stay here without question.  We did get the sense that it was a business traveller hotel, which is surprising really as it is perfect for tourists too.",5
"Trident Gurgaon is a beautiful hotel. The staff members are so accommodating and the atmosphere is uplifting and serene. It is a safe haven to come ""home"" to after a long day. There are a lot of options of food, from American to Indian (obviously) Japanese, Greek, Italian and more! I felt like a part of a wonderful family while staying here! Thank you Trident for making my stay so enjoyably!  I would suggest the garden or pool side view for your room. Simply amazing!",5
"The Trident is a great hotel, particularly if you like to be pampered. It covers a vast set of corridors and has a good location. The food is great, there is a wide selection of options including Indian, Asian and more typical cuisine, and they are very keen to respond to feedback.  The only minus points are that it is quite a walk to get anywhere but at least this is almost always in Aircon.  The pool is lovely, but in the summer it is really too hot to swim.  The gym is well stocked, but bizarrely the pool bar seems to shut about 10 PM which seems a way too early.  Wonderful place but you do get a little tired of being greeted by every employee, I once counted 18 ""Good morning's"" on my way to reception.",4
"This was my glorious, gorgeous sanctuary. What a delight to come back to beauty at every turn and service beyond compare after an exhausting day of sightseeing. My husband always stays here when he comes to India on business but this was my first trip to India. The chef, Saudamini made a special dinner so that I could sample traditional Indian food and now I am a huge fan! The concierge planned a perfect day trip out to the Taj. Every member of the staff was kind and helpful beyond anything I have experienced before and I have been a lot of places. Thank you for the soups Nayad and Tauseef, I hope to come back so we can deliver those coats to the poor children.",5
"I've stayed at the Trident several times over the last few years. In some ways it is an odd place - lots of hustle and bustle just outside on the main road. You take a turn into the Trident and it is quiet and peaceful. The service is great - lovely customisation. For example - I stayed there one time for 10 days. The head chef gave me his card and said he would make me anything I wanted as I would probably get bored of the food there. I ordered some Sri Lankan food for lunch on the Sunday and it was fab. The only minor complaint I have is the internet is expensive. Other than that, top notch hotel.",5
This was our second stay( First one was in 2012).Previous to that used to stay in the center of Delhi.Trident is very convenient for the airport and relatively easy to get into Delhi. Good shopping malls few minutes drive away.As stated by many others it really is an Oasis. Pool facing rooms are fantastic and there is an excellant choice of food etc. Service from everyone at the hotel is second to none..   Must say special thank you to general manager Nitesh Gandhi and duty manager Arjun Belliappa who went out of their way to make sure our stay was wonderful. Would highly recommend this hotel and will only stay here on future trips    Rohit Shaunak,5
"An oasis in the middle of chaos. Flawless service and dedicated personal attention. Very convenient for Delhi airport and Gurgaon corporate offices, too far for Delhi's main attractions. Gorgeous pool.",5
This is a really impressive hotel - right from the reception to the rooms to the pool and the spa ! The service is super super and the food excellent ! The rooms are quite a walk away though so you may decide to select rooms appropriately.,5
"From the hotel pickup to the hotel dropoff back at the airport, everything about the Trident Gurgaon was excellent, including the location for business meetings in Gurgaon.  I will definitely stay there next time.",5
"We were booked into The Trident which was certainly nearer than a down town Delhi Hotel as we were flying out in the morning. Great style, typical Oberoi service and efficiency and on our way home in a weeks time we have changed back to The Trident from our original booking. Nice coffee shop and pool area, not that we used the pool",5
"Very impressive property. Great design, top notch service. Restaurant is very good too. You won't be disappointed here. My only two issues are, first, the fire alarms kept going off each night and in one case, it went off at 7am for about 20 minutes. Second, the hotel nickels and dimes you on Internet charges. When I asked them about it, they said ""it's hotel policy"".  To that I say, change the policy. When you are paying 19,000 R per night, either include it the rate or offer different pricing levels as most other hotels do that include it. After I checked out here and went to the Ritz Carlton in Bangalore (a better and less expensive property), there was no messing around with logging Ina no buying a package each day.  Oberoi - figure it out.",4
"Stayed at the Trident for 4 nights whilst on a sightseeing tour of Delhi and surrounding area.  This hotel is exceptional. The design, tranquility and most importantly the quality of service and staff would be hard to beat.",5
This is a lovely hotel and close to Gurgaon businesses.  It has a great pool and pretty good gym as well as feeling like a smaller hotel as it mostly low rise.  Very good size rooms and unobtrusive service.,4
"I first stayed in the Trident in 2004 when I arrived for work. I stayed around three months and was overwhelmed by the quality of service, staff and standard of the Hotel. Today is no different, I stayed with my wife and daughter for a couple of nights in early October, and honestly! all of the qualities it had then, are here today in equal or better measure!   I recommend anyone who is on holiday or business to look no further.   The hustle and bustle of the surrounding streets are immediately muted as you enter the premises, smiles and warmth emanate from the staff, and however full the hotel, you feel as though it is all yours. The restaurants are excellent, with lots of choice, and it is never too much for the chefs to prepare something specifically to your liking.  The 25",5
"This is a fantastic hotel with high ceilings, beautiful landscaping, and service which will take away all of your worries. I had gone for a business meeting over the weekend and it was a memorable experience.",5
"Beautifully constructed around a host of water features, space is no issue at this astonishingly tranquil hotel. White stone, high ceilings, deep blue expansive pools of water, and a hushed silence. After the madness of the streets, this is a great place to stop off. Staff are genuinely helpful and friendly. Nothing seems to be too much trouble. Note, however, that it is a longish drive from the tourist parts of Delhi under common Delhi driving conditions.  We stayed twice, both times for one night either end of a plane ride. Both times we had rooms overlooking a wide courtyard which was essentially all water.The first visit, we had some sort of larger room with a king size bed. While clearly better than the standard doubles - the bathroom is bigger, too - I am not sure that I",4
We had a wonderful week at the Trident. All aspects were fantastic.  Everything was up to the highest standard and nothing was short of perfect.   The restaurants are delicious and must be tried. The ervice was impeccable!  Thank you!,5
"An overall great stay at a beautiful 5 star hotel that has a resort type feel. The staff here really stood out with excellent customer care. The room itself was comfortable and the big open windows created a lovely atmosphere. The hotel is spread out around the swimming pool and everything has a very middle eastern feel. We tried all 3 of the eateries and each one was excellent, the morning breakfast was also tasty with everything and more on offer. They provide a car to take you to the closest mall and you can also just walk 5 mins to the Oberoi and enjoy the facilities there too. The spa rooms here are the best I have come accross, they are spacious and very relaxing and make a treatment here worthwhile. My daughter was unwell and they called a doctor within 2 hours, I",4
"I stayed here twice - once in September, once in October.  Both for work.  The staff is amazingly friendly - made some friends on the September trip who recognized me instantaneously on the October trip.  The provide anything you could possibly need without even asking: one day, I returned to my room to a note which told me that the housekeeping staff noticed I was running low on toothpaste so they got me a replacement. !!  Some of my colleagues mentioned they got laptop cleaning kits in their rooms.  One even had a doll left for her because she had a conversation with the housekeeper about their daughters!   My other favorite: I was running late on my last morning and I didn't have time for breakfast.  One of the dining staff noticed and brought me coffee and a few pastries in",5
"This is the best business hotel in Gurgaon.  The staff are genuinely helpful and attentive, without being imposing.  The hotel is very spacious, laid out mostly at ground level around the central pool area.  This creates a relaxing, quiet, peaceful atmosphere in the midst of the chaotic nature of Gurgaon.  You can't hear traffic from anywhere in the hotel, unlike many of the other high rise properties in the city.  There's a choice of three restaurants, which is important if you're staying for any length of time.  Additionally, the hotel adjoins the Oberoi where you'll find three more restaurants to choose from.  The Trident lives up to international standards, whereas many others in the area simply do not.  Given the choice, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5
Had the most amazing time in Trident  Chef Saudamani and team took really good care of me Hotel staff is the best i have come across The make everyone feel at ease  The best part is that they remember your name and always have a smile on their face,5
By far the Best service I got so far. Staff is outstanding Food is excellent and stunning property. Make sure spend some time in the Hotel to enjoy the greenery and pamper yourself with attention and service you get !!,5
"It was afternoon of 13 October 2014. I had been there for the first time to meet my friend. What a lovely ambiance it has. It gives a look of ancient structure with a very big water reservoir in front of the entrance to the main lobby. The ambience is very serene. The decor was very soothing and all the male & female staff were elegantly dressed and were very well mannered. The food was very tasty and well presented. My friend was very much satisfied with Trident, would recommend for weekend trip as well peaceful stay. Must visit if you have not yet. . . . . Capt. Pran",5
"i'm coming to India every month to all major cities and stayed with a lot of hotels across both New Delhi and Gurgaon - Trident Gurgaon is really the best place both for business trip and for a family weekend. It's not as posch as the Leela Palace in New Delhi (and not so expensive) and it's giving you a true home feeling and peace in your mind, awesome pool and great restaurants and very good location - quite close to airport, very close to Ambience Mall and to business centers and offices. AND i never ever met THAT level of service you see here - last time on my trip i lost my laptop in the plane and discovered that only 2am in the hotel - they have managed to get it back to me in just a few hours!!! keep coming here again and again and even when offered Oberoi upgrade never",5
"On my official trip to Gurgaon, I put up in Hotel Trident Gurgaon. One of the best ever property i have ever seen. Most courteous staff, very good hospitality. Best part, they have free pick up and drop to Ambience mall in Gurgaon and that too in luxurious cars like Merc/Audi. I am impressed. Would strongly recommend Trident to all my friends. One must experience the hospitality of this great property.",5
I stayed at the Trident for around 10 days.  The staff was excellent and very service oriented.  The food was superb and if you wanted something not on the menu the chef was happy to oblige. Spa/Fitness area very nice as well as the property in general.,5
"I belong to Gurgaon only and have heard a lot about Trident. I must say that the rating is 100% correct and Trident is must go place for leisure atleast.  Me and my wife went for my birthday. Stayed their for just one day, but it was very comforting. The swimming pool in one of the best in Gurgaon and their breakfast was amazing. We also liked the warm nature of their staff.  Definitely coming back for SPA next time.",5
"Awesome weekend spent at Trident GGN in the lap of perfect Oberoi hospitality. The staff was more than eager to help and always smiled and greeted the guests so dutifully and politely. Food was excellent and staff went out if their way to make the stay friendly for our kids. The place is so serene and calm, and we almost felt guilty when the kids disturbed the calmness. But overall a fab stay and a weekend to remember!!!",5
I was at trident for 2 days and night and the experience  was way beyond my expectation in every way  The Ambiance: we had taken the pool facing room and we were not aware that such a serene and calm ambience is waiting for us. It was just perfect as the trip was a leisure trip to unwind from the daily routine.  Service:  Incredible service..the staff goes extra mile to make the guest comfortable in every possible way. From driver to the head chef everyone was so cheerful and warm in the behavior.. Kudos to the entire team for the same.  Food:  great!!!! good spread in the buffet menu and so is the thali at saffron.... here again every staff member ensures to cater to guest requirement with a smile   Overall:  Awesome Awesome and Awesome..i couldnt believe that i m in midst of,5
"Five star fantastic. Beautiful and immaculate rooms. Professional and friendly staff (they put us in an upgraded presidential suite). We were pampered beyond words! Little touches such as delectable fruit placed in our room, fresh flowers, the list could go on and on.",5
"I recently stayed at the Trident in mid September on my own for a week as part of business trip to Gurgaon. This was my third stay here.  There are plenty of other excellent reviews that more than adequately cover the hotel, facilities, dining rooms, pool etc etc so I won't comment on those but I will add my own thoughts on the levels of service at this wonderful hotel.  I've been fortunate enough to be able to travel a lot during my 25 year working life. Most business/luxury hotels are relatively similar - nice rooms, pools, gyms, restaurants and facilities. Flat screen TV's, mini bar, toiletries, and DVD players. After a while it's hard to differentiate one from the next...  However, where the Trident stands out, for me, is the incredible levels of service. Without exception,",5
"Spent the weekend at this Hotel with family. Very nice property, probably the best Trident after Udaipur which wins on location. If only this one could be transplanted there.  This hotel has a very calming and tranquil ambience with nice restaurants and public areas. The legendary Oberoi service lives on here both in the hotel and the restaurants. They are a bit beyond perfect sometimes. A broken cigarette lighter left in our room was fixed without us even asking!   Sometimes I wish I could write a unflattering review for an Oberoi hotel. I will keep staying in their hotels till i can afford them to find that unhappy and improbable occassion.",5
was a good stay. still have good memories. We did not eat in the hotel but. The room was amply comfortable and luxurious. We would probably go and stay there again.  totally recommend it to other people.,4
"Our family (mum, dad and 3 young boys aged 5, 8 and 10) stayed at the Trident Gurgaon for 2 days/nights in late June 2014 at the end of our almost 3 week vacation in northern India during which we stayed at 7 Oberoi properties (including all 4 vilas).   I had enjoyed my stays at the Trident Gurgaon in previous years on business travel, so I insisted our family stay here rather than at another Oberoi property. Our family visit this time at the Trident Gurgaon confirmed for us that it is at least as good if not better than the typically top-notch Oberoi experience!   The Trident Gurgaon property and ambience are spectacular ‚Äì a grand yet understated business hotel, but also well suited for a vacationing family. But what impressed us was the outstanding level of service by the",5
"The location is ideal for the business traveller being close to for the new Gurgaon business areas such as Cyber Hub and it is only a short drive to the airport. However, it is the service provided that sets this hotel apart; the staff are proficient and friendly, quickly putting you at ease in the impressive surroundings.",5
"Good food, efficient and hospitable staff are some of the plus points of this hotel. Though difficult to maintain because of properties spread over a large area but the management is doing well to maintain a good standard.",4
"I have stayed at the Trident on three occasions over the past 4 months, each time for a stay of more than 7 days.  Everything about the place is magnificent and in keeping with what one can expect of a top flight, world class hotel.  Particular mention should be made of both the excellence of the staff and the food in the restaurants.  It's just a wonderful place to be.",5
"We stayed at this hotel largely for the purpose of transit in to and out of India for our wildlife holiday on recommendation/organisation of our tour company but we wished we had the opportunity to stay longer.  Reception / check in was faultless on both occasions - one night and separately a day room before out flight to Hong Kong.  The grounds and facilities were first class, as was our room on both occasions (upgraded on our first stay).  On our second visit, the service and room was just as spot on as if we had been guests staying for several days.  The grounds, water features and pool are breathtaking and extremely relaxing.  You truly feel like you are in a different world.  Service at the pool was excellent, as was the choice of restaurants, quality of food and service. ",5
"I couldn't fault it. The room was lovely, the pool was fantastic, the food was great, and the staff were wonderful. The hotel is incredibly peaceful, in lovely surroundings.  It is a little way out of the city, so you need a taxi to get anywhere, but that does also mean that it is closer to Delhi airport and Delhi itself.",5
"A place that takes you to an all together different world, being part of a hustle bustle city you get a sense of serene and calm surrounding, with hospitality to the epitome of class, a true worth it..... :-)",5
"One of the finest experiences I've had in terms of the ambiance , serenity and the service by the staff. The food and the personalized services is unmatched. Is quite near to the airport ,Key business district & fantastic night life area ""Cyberhub"" in Gurgaon",5
"It was an amazing experience in Trident Gurgaon , staff was very curtious , property looks like a resort .... Amongst of all     FOOOOOODDDD   Excellent    i stayed here for 3 days  every day we were trying new dishes  suggested by the restaurant captain  and food was really excellent ,  specailly i liked   DAL MAKHNI   with live music in Saffron restaurant.  :)",5
Immaculate service throughout stay. Great Ambience and Lovely Food. Lovely stay.There was always someone or the other to assist in any even smallest of requirement right from reaching me to my room or restaurant and back to my room.,5
We stayed at this hotel for just a day while awaiting our late night flight back to the US.  The room was very comfortable.  The hotel is quite large and rooms can be quite a walk from the lobby or the restaurant. Our evening meal was very good.  Nice hotel - we would stay here again.,4
My first stay in Trident Gurgaon was amazing. Very spread out hotel with lovely water bodies and landscaping. The food was excellent. Nice gym and helpful staff. A very specious lobby area for an appointment or just for relaxing. A great place to stay.,5
"This was my 2nd visit to the Trident property and reserved my review to see if the 2nd time around was as good as the 1st. And it sure was!!! This is a beautiful hotel that does not have the look and feel of a city hotel at all, though it just opposite the busy CyberCity business hub of Gurgaon. So after a long day's work when you return it is wonderful to feel the calm and peace of a resort hotel backed by great service of the very friendly and helpful staff. They are what makes the property even better. Keep up the standards guys !",4
"I will keep my review short and precise.  Trident Hotels have a theme of Height Light and Space. Based on the Moroccon architecture, Trident Gurgaon is the ultra Lap of luxury you can lie in.  We spent couple of days there and it has been like you are totally in different world alltogther. Place is nice and very well located with all the amenities you can ask for.  Only issue is that it doesnt provide free wifi services  A word of advice - always go for pool view rooms",5
"Checked in to The Trident for a weekend and wished I was a long staying guest. The warmth, the service the ambience all are excellent ! The Spa was great, food lovely and the silence was sheer luxury!  Room could have been larger",5
"I had a very short stay in the hotel as I had to catch a very early morning flight but in a couple of hours the hotel left and amazing positive impression on me. Beautifully made , great food and the most sweetest staff.  Loved the way they lit the Mashals in the night giving it a very palace look . Totally recommended !!!!",5
"Lovely accommodations. Clean, spacious, modern with tremendous service. Grounds are breathtaking. Only ate at restaurant for breakfast, it was very good. Rooms are adequately supplies with bottled water. Wifi or the inability to connect is my only reason for not giving this resort top ratings.",4
"The hotel is extremely lush with soft touches,  friendly smiles,  and great service add you might expect from a hotel of this class.   The grounds are lovely,  the breakfast extensive,  and the room very comfortable.  Situated well for business in Gurgaon I can't say how close it is to typical tourist spots though the hotel drivers are very professional and friendly. For business in the area the hotel is a great sanctuary from the craziness on the roads. ",5
"I spent a day here at the beginning and end of my trip. This hotel is the perfect oasis away from the bustle of Gurgaon.   Service was unbeatable. Staff was super courteous. I liked that they posted that no tips were necessary.   Please try the breakfast buffet. Enormous selection of delicious food in an amazing setting. I am still thinking about the sweet lime juice that I drank six months later.    The room was nice, clean and had everything you need   The pool is surrounded by gorgeously manicured trees and is supremely peaceful. I also tried the spa and had an insanely great facial and massage. This was the perfect place to relax before a long flight home. Very close to the airport and they can provide a nice car to get you there. Highly recommend and will definitely be",5
"it was my second stay at this hotel and its best as always the best staff , perfect peace and lovely decors , quick check in and best thing is that you are really pampered and true flavors of indian hospitality .",5
"This hotel is almost odd in that it has lots of wasted space - courtyards but with no where to sit. It is photographs well but it almost feels deserted even though it was not!  It's cold and modern with little charm.  The pool is lovely though and it is very quiet as it is walled off from the street.  The wait staff interrupts meals frequently to ask how you are doing, first visit? how is the food etc!  It's too much and I found myself avoiding eye contact.  Five visits during one meal is too much!  I thought the nearby Oberio would be where all the charm was but visited one night to find it was much the same!",4
"This hotel is really amazing. Me and my colleague spent here three fantastic weeks thanks to the excellent guys who work for this hotel.  In particular, the talented cook Vidhu who has prepared us a different and high standard dish every night. The waiters Praveen, Raman, Tanuj, Abhijit and all the others that have always been very kind and professional. In the swimmimg pool area Ashish and Rohit were always present and made us feel at our ease during our stay in this hotel. We will definetly come here again in the event that we will return to Gurgaon.",5
I had a trip to Gurgaon for work and stayed at this property for about a week and a half. The property is amazing and has a beautiful layout. I stayed in one of the rooms with a pool view which was fantastic. During my stay the staff were wonderful. Everyone is extremely pleasant and always willing to help you in any way possible. The food is great as well and the service in the morning at breakfast was always very attentive and you could get in and out relatively quickly if needed. Overall it was a pleasant stay and I look forward to staying there again in the future.,5
"excellent!. total comfort and best homely feeling. great experience. Rooms, quality of the food,service, staff, cleanliness levels are super. really enjoyed the stay and hope to come back soon. it was an accidental visit but this accident was worth repeating many times.",5
"This place is posh, really posh, I felt out of place here.  Every door had somebody to open it for you, in fact every last thing possible was done for you.   Room was large, shower was fantastic, bed was OK, but no where near as good as Premier Inn in the UK.  The price, at 10,000 a night is expensive for the location, but great value compared to the UK. However, it excludes some hefty taxes, and a glass of coke in the bar almost breaks the bank.  The location, a short distance from the office, was great for me.",3
